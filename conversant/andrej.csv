Andrej Karpathy,think it's possible that physics has exploits and we should be trying to find them.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,arranging some kind of a crazy quantum mechanical system that somehow gives you buffer overflow somehow gives you a rounding error and the floating point.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Synthetic intelligences are kind of like the next stage of development.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I don't know where it leads to like at some point, I suspect the universe is some kind of a puzzle, these synthetic AIS will uncover that puzzle and solve it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,The following is a conversation with Andre Karpati.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Previously, the director of AI at Tesla.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And before that, at open AI, and Stanford, he is one of the greatest scientists, engineers and educators in the history of artificial intelligence.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"This is the LEX Friedman podcast to support it, please check out our sponsors.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And now, dear friends, here's Andre kabaah thing.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What is a neural network?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And why does it seem to do such a surprisingly good job of learning?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"What is a neural network, it's a mathematical abstraction of the brain, I would say that's how it was originally developed.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"At the end of the day, it's a mathematical expression.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it's a fairly simple mathematical expression when you get down to it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's basically a sequence of matrix multiplies whichever li dot products mathematically, and some non linearity is thrown in.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so it's a very simple mathematical expression.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And it's got knobs in it many knobs, many knobs, and these knobs are loosely related to basically the synapses in your brain.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"They're trainable, they're modifiable.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so the idea is like, we need to find the setting of the knobs that makes the neural net, do whatever you want it to do, like classify images, and so on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so there's not too much mystery, I was saying that like, you might think that basically don't want to endow it with too much meaning with respect to the brain and how it works.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's really just a complicated mathematical expression with knobs.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And those knobs need a proper setting for it to do something desirable.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, but poetry","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"is just a collection of letters with spaces, but it can make us feel a certain way.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"In that same way, when you get a large number of knobs together, whether it's in the inside the brain or inside a computer, they seem to.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,They seem to surprise us with the power.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I think that's fair.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So basically, I'm underselling it by a lot, because you definitely do get very surprising emergent behaviors out of these neural nets when they're large enough and trained on complicated enough problems.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Like say, for example, the next word prediction in a massive data set from the internet.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then these neural nets they call pretty surprising magical properties.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I think it's kind of interesting how much you can get out of even very simple mathematical formalism,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,when your brain right now is talking.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Is it doing next word prediction?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Or is it doing something more interesting?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Well, definitely some kind of a generative model.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,That's a GPT.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Like and prompted by you.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So you're giving me a prompt?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I'm kind of like responding to it in a generative way.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And by yourself, perhaps a little bit?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like, are you adding extra prompts from your own memory inside your head?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Or no, definitely feels like you're referencing some kind of a declarative structure of like, memory, and so on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then you're putting that together with your prompt and giving away some so,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"how much of what you just said, has been said by you before?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Nothing basically, right?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"No, but if you actually look at all the words you've ever said in your life, and you do a search, you'll probably said, a lot of the same words in the same order before.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, could be.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I mean, I'm using phrases that are common, etc.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But I'm really mixing it into a pretty sort of unique sentence at the end of the day.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But you're right, definitely, there's like a ton of re mixing","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"why you, didn't you?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It's like Magnus Carlsen said, I'm ready to 2900 Whatever, which is pretty decent.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I think you're talking very, you're not giving enough credit to neural nets here.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Why do they seem to work?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What's your best intuition about this emergent behavior?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Um, it's kind of interesting, because I'm simultaneously underselling them.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But I also feel like there's an element to which I'm over.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Like, it's actually kind of incredible that you can get so much emergent magical behavior out of them, despite them being so simple mathematically.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So I think those are kind of like two surprising statements that are kind of just juxtaposed together.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I think basically, what it is, is we are actually fairly good at optimizing these neural nets.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And when you give them a hard enough problem, they are forced to learn very interesting solutions in the optimization.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And those solution basically have these emergent properties that are very interesting.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"There's wisdom and knowledge in the knobs, and so on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yes, this representation that's in the knobs doesn't make sense to you intuitively, the large number of knobs can hold a representation that captures some deep wisdom about the data.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It has looked at a lot of knobs.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's a lot of knobs And somehow, you know, so speaking concretely, one of the neural nets that people are very excited about right now are our GPS, which are basically just next word prediction networks.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So you consume a sequence of words from the internet, and you try to predict the next word.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And once you train these on a large enough data set, they, you can basically prompt these neural nets in arbitrary ways.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And you can ask them to solve problems, and they will.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So you can just tell them, you can, you can make it look like you're trying to solve some kind of a mathematical problem.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And they will continue to do what they think is the solution based on what they've seen on the internet.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And very often, those solutions look very remarkably consistent look correct, potentially.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Do you still think about the brain side of it?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So as neural nets is an abstraction or mathematical abstraction of the brain, these still draw wisdom from, from the biological neural networks are even the bigger question.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So you're a big fan of biology and biological computation.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"What impressive thing is biology do doing to you that computers are not yet that gap,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I would say I'm definitely on a much more hesitant with the analogies to the brain than I think you would see potentially in the field.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I kind of feel like, certainly, the way neural networks started is everything stemmed from inspiration of the brain, but at the end of the day, the artifacts that you get after training, they are arrived at by a very different optimization process than the optimization process that gave rise to the brain.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so I think, I kind of think of it as a very complicated alien artifact, it's something different, doesn't necessarily the, the neural nets that we're training, okay, they are complicated alien artifact, I do not make analogies to the brain, because I think the optimization process that gave rise to it is very different from the brain.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So there was no multi agent self play kind of setup, and evolution, it was an optimization, that is basically a what amounts to a compression objective on a massive amount of data.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Okay, so artificial neural networks are doing compression, and biological neural networks are to survive.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And by really doing a they're, they're an agent in a multi agent, self play system that has been running for a very, very long time.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"That said, evolution has found that it is very useful to, to predict and have a predictive model in the brain.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so I think our brain utilizes something that looks like that as a part of it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But it has a lot more, you know, couches and gizmos, and value functions and ancient nuclei that are all trying to like make us survive and reproduce and everything else.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And the whole thing through embryogenesis is built from a single cell.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I mean, it's just the code is inside the DNA.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And it just builds it up like the entire organism with,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,crazy head,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,and legs.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And like,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,it's does it pretty well.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It may not be possible.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So there's some learning going on.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,There's some there's some there's some kind of competition going through that building process.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I mean, I don't know where if you're just the look at the entirety of history of life on Earth, what do you think is the most interesting invention?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Is it the origin of life itself?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Is it just jumping to eukaryotes?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Is it mammals?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Is a humans themselves almost Sapiens, the origin of intelligence or highly complex intelligence?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Or?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Or is it all just a continuation of the same kind of process?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Certainly, I would say it's an extremely remarkable story that I'm only like briefly learning about recently, all the way from actually like, you almost have to start at the formation of earth, and all of its conditions and the entire solar system and how everything is arranged with Jupiter and Moon and the habitable zone and everything.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then you have an active earth that's turning over material.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then you start with a view about Genesis and everything.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so it's all like a pretty remarkable story.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I'm not sure that I can pick like a single unique piece of it, that I find most interesting.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I guess for me, as an artificial intelligence researcher, it's probably the last piece we have lots of animals that, you know, are, are not building technological society.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But we do.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it seems to have happened very quickly.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It seems to have happened very recently.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And something very interesting happened there that I don't fully understand.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I almost understand everything else, kind of I think intuitively.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But I don't understand exactly that part.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And how quick that was.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Both explanations will be interesting.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,One is that this is just a continuation of the same kind of process.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"There's nothing special about humans, that will be deeply understanding that will be very interesting that we think of ourselves as special but it was obvious all it was already written in, in the code that you would have greater and greater until just emerging.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And then the other explanation, which is something truly special happened something like a rare event, whether it's like crazy rare event like Space Odyssey, what would it be?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"See if you say like the invention of fire, or the, as Richard Wrangham says the beta males deciding a clever way to kill the alpha males by collaborating, so just optimizing the collaboration, the really the multi agent aspects of the multi agent, and that really being constrained on resources and trying to survive.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,The collaboration aspect is what created the complex intelligence.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,But it seems like it's a natural outgrowth of the evolution process.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What could possibly be a magical thing that happened?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Like a rare thing that would say that humans are actually human level intelligence is actually a really rare thing in the universe?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I'm hesitant to say that it is rare, by the way, but it definitely seems like it's kind of like a punctuated equilibrium where you have lots of exploration, and then you have certain leaps, as far as leaps in between.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So of course, like origin of life would be one, you know, DNA, sex, eukaryotic systems, eukaryotic life, the endosymbiosis event or the archaeon, eight little bacteria, you know, just the whole thing.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then, of course, the emergence of consciousness and so on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So it seems like different to that are sports events where massive amount of progress was made?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But yet, it's kind of hard to pick one?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Do you don't think humans are unique, that I asked you?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,How many intelligent alien civilizations do you think are out there?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And is their intelligence different or similar to ours?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I've been preoccupied with this question quite a bit recently, basically, the Fermi paradox and just thinking through and and the reason, actually, that I am very interested in the origin of life is fundamentally trying to understand how common it is that there are technological societies out there in space, and the more I study it, the more I think that there should be quite a few, quite a lot.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Why haven't we heard from them, because I agree with you, it feels like, I just don't see why the what we did here on Earth is so difficult to do.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, and especially when you get into the details of it, I used to think origin of life was very, it was this magical rare event, but then you read books, like, for example, in the clean, the vital question, whole life ascending, etc.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And he really gets in.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And he really makes you believe that this is not that rare, basic chemistry, you have an active earth, and you have your alkaline vents, and you have lots of alkaline water mixing, whether it's a devotion, and you have your proton gradients, and you have the global powers pockets of these Klein vents that concentrate chemistry.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And basically, as he steps through all of these little pieces, you start to understand that, actually, this is not that crazy, you could see this happen on other systems.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And he really takes you from just a geology to primitive life.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And he makes it feel like it's actually pretty plausible.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And also, like the origin of life didn't was actually fairly fast after formation of Earth.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"If I remember correctly, just a few 100 million years for something like that after basically when it was possible life actually arose.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So that makes me feel that that is not the constraint, that is not the limiting variable, and that life should actually be fairly common.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then you know, where the drop offs are, is very, is very interesting to think about.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I currently think that there's no major drop offs, basically.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so there should be quite a lot of life.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And basically, what we're that brings me to then is the only way to reconcile the fact that we haven't found anyone and so on is that we just can't we can't see them.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,We can't observe them.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Just a quick brief comment, Nick lane, and a lot of biologists I talked to, they really seem to think that the jump from bacteria to more complex organisms is the hardest","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,jump.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,The eukaryotic life.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Which,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I don't I get it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,They're much more knowledgeable than me about like the intricacies of biology.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"But that seems like crazy, because how much how many single celled organisms are there?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Like and how much time you have?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Surely, it's not that difficult.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Like in a billion years.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It's not even that long.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Of a time really, just all these bacteria under constrained resources, battling it out.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I'm sure they can invent more complex.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I don't understand.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It's like, how to move from a Hello World program to like, like, invent a function or something like that.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I don't.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So I don't Yeah, so I'm with you.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I just feel like I don't see any.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"If the origin of life, that will be my intuition.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,That's the hardest thing.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"But if that's not the hardest thing, because it happened so quickly, then it's got to be everywhere.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And yeah, maybe we're just too dumb to see it","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,was just we don't have really good mechanisms for seeing this life.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I mean, by what How.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So I'm not an expert just to preface this, but just from what I","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"was, I want to meet an expert on alien intelligence and how to communicate, I'm","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,very suspicious of our ability to find these intelligences out there.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And to find these Earth, like radio waves, for example, are are terrible, their power drops off as basically one over r square.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So I remember reading that are current radio waves, but not be the ones that we are broadcasting would not be measurable by our devices today, only like was it like 1/10 of a light year away, like not even basically tiny distance, because you really need like a targeted transmission of massive power directed somewhere for this to be picked up on Long, long distances.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so I just think that our ability to measure is, is not amazing.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I think there's probably other civilizations out there.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then the big question is, why don't they build von Neumann probes?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And why don't they interstellar travel across the entire galaxy?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And my current answer is, it's probably interstellar travel is like really hard.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"You have the interstellar medium, if you want to move at close to the speed of light, you're going to be encountering bullets along the way.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Because even like tiny hydrogen atoms and little particles of dust are basically we have like massive kinetic energy at those speeds.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so basically, you need some kind of shielding, you need, you have all the cosmic radiation.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's just like brutal out there.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's really hard.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so my thinking is, maybe interstellar travel is just extremely hard.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I think you have two years to build hard.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It feels like, it feels like we're not a billion years away from doing that,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"it just might be that it's very, you have to go very slowly, potentially, as an example, through space, right, as opposed to close to the speed of light.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So I'm suspicious basically, of our ability to measure life.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I'm suspicious of the ability to just permeate all of space in the galaxy or across galaxies.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And that's the only way that I can, I can currently see a way around it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It's kind of mind blowing to think that there's trillions of intelligent alien civilizations out there, kind of slowly traveling through space made to meet each other and some of them meet.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Some of them go to war, some of them collaborate.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And more.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"They're all just independent, just like little pockets.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"For statistically, if there's like, emphasis trillions of them, surely some of them, some of the pockets are close enough to get some of them happen to be close.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"enough, close enough to see each other.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And then once you see once you see something that is definitely complex life, like if we see something, yeah, we're probably going to be severe, like intensely aggressively motivated to figure out what the hell that is, and try to meet them.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"But what will be your first instinct to try to, like at a generational level, meet them?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Or defend against them?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Or what would be your instinct, as a President of the United States?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And the scientists?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I don't know which hat you prefer in this question.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I think the question, it's really hard.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I will say like, for example, for us, we have lots of primitive life forms on Earth.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Next to us, we have all kinds of ants and everything else, and we share space with them.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And we are hesitant to impact on them and to we are trying to protect them by default.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Because they are amazing, interesting dynamical systems that took a long time to evolve.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And they are interesting and special.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I don't know that you want to destroy that by default.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so I like complex dynamical systems that took a lot of time to evolve, I think I'd like to, I like to preserve it, if I can afford to.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I'd like to think that the same would be true about the galactic resources, and that, they would think that we're kind of incredible, interesting story that took time, it took a few billion years to unravel, and you don't want to just destroy it,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I can see two aliens talking about Earth right now and saying, I'm a big fan of complex dynamical systems.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So I think it was a value to preserve these who basically are a video game they watch or show a TV show that they watch.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I think you need like a very good reason, I think to, to destroy it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Like, why don't we destroy these and farms and so on?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's because we're not actually like, really in direct competition with them right now.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"We do it accidentally, and so on, but there's plenty of resources.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so why would you destroy something that is so interesting and precious?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Well, from a scientific perspective, you might probe it, you might interact with it, you might want to learn something from it, right?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So I wonder there's could be certain physical phenomena that we think is a physical phenomena, but it's actually interacting with us to like, poke the finger and see what happens.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I think it,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"should be very interesting to scientists, other alien scientists what happened here.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And you know, it's a, what we're seeing today is a snapshot.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Basically, it's a result of a huge amount of computation of over like billing years or something like that.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,it could have been initiated by aliens.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"This could be a computer running a program, like when, okay, if you had the power to do this well When you okay, for sure, at least I would, I would pick an Earth like planet that has the conditions based my understanding of the chemistry prerequisites for life.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And I would see them with life and run it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Right?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like yeah, when do you want 100%?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Do that and observe it and then protect?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I mean that that's not just a hell of a good TV show.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It's it's a good scientific experiment.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And that is its physical simulation, right?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"What maybe, maybe the evolution is the most like actually running it is the most efficient way to understand computation or to compute stuff, or to understand","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"life, or, you know, what life looks like, and what branches it can take.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"That doesn't make me kind of feel weird that we're part of a science experiment, but maybe it's everything's a science experiments.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Does that change anything for us?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,For a science experiment?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,To descendants of apes talking about being inside of the sun?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I'm suspicious of this idea of like, deliberate panspermia, as you would describe that service.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I don't see a divine intervention in some way.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,In the in the historical record right now.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I do feel like the story in these in these books, like necklines books, and so on sort of makes sense.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it makes sense how life arose on Earth uniquely.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And yeah, I don't need to, I mean, I don't need to reach for more exotic explanations right now.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Sure.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But NPCs,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"inside of video game, don't.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Don't don't observe any divine intervention, either.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,We might just be all NPCs or any kind of code.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Maybe,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"eventually, they will currently NPCs are really dumb.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But once they're running GPS, maybe they will be like, Hey, this is really suspicious.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,What the hell.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So you famously tweeted, it looks like if you bombard Earth with photons for a while, you can emit a roadster.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So if like an Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, we would summarize the story of Earth.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So in that book, it's mostly harmless.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"What do you think is all the possible stories, like a paragraph long or sentence long?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,That Earth could be summarized?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,As at once it done its computation?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So like, all the possible full?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"If Earth is a book, right, yeah.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Probably there has to be an ending.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I mean, there's going to be an end to Earth, and we could end in all kinds of ways you can end soon you can then later, what do you think are the possible stories?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Well, definitely,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"there seems to be, yeah, you're sort of, it's pretty incredible that the self replicating systems will basically arise from the dynamics, and then they perpetuate themselves and become more complex and eventually become conscious and build a society.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I kind of feel like, in some sense, it's kind of like, a deterministic wave, that, you know, that kind of just like happens on any, you know, any sufficiently well arranged system like Earth.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so I kind of feel like there's a certain sense of inevitability in it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it's really beautiful.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And it ends somehow, right?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So it's a, it's a chemically, a diverse environment, where complex dynamical systems can evolve and become more and more further and further complex.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,But then there's a certain what is it?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,There's certain terminating conditions?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,You guys don't know what the terminating conditions are.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But definitely, there's a trend line of something.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And we're part of that story.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And like, where does that where does it go?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So, you know, we're famously described often as a biological bootloader for AI.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And that's because humans, I mean, you know, we're an incredible biological system, and we're capable of computation, and, you know, and love and so on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But we're extremely inefficient as well, like we're talking to each other through audio, it's just kind of embarrassing, honestly, that we're manipulating like seven symbols serially, we're using vocal cords, it's all happening over like multiple seconds.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's just like kind of embarrassing when you step down to the frequencies at which computers operate, or are able to cooperate on And so basically, it does seem like synthetic intelligences are kind of like the next stage of development.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I don't know where it leads to like, at some point, I suspect the universe is some kind of a puzzle.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And these synthetic AIS will uncover that puzzle and solve it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And then what happens after right like what because if you just like Fast Forward Earth, many buildings yours, it's like, it's quiet.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And then it's like, turmoil you see like city lights and stuff like that.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And then what happens at like at the end like is it like a?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It's like a calming, is it explosion?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Is it like Earth like open like a giant because you said omit roaster roasters, it was start emitting like, like a giant number of like satellites.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yes, some kind of a crazy explosion and we're living.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,We're like We're stepping through a explosion.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And we're like living day to day and doesn't look like it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But it's actually if you I saw a very cool animation of Earth, and life on Earth, and basically nothing happens for a long time.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then the last like two seconds, like basically cities and everything.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And the low Earth orbit just gets cluttered.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And just the whole thing happens in the last few seconds.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And you're like, This is exploding.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Statement explosion.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So if you play yeah, if you play at a normal speed, yeah, it'll just look like an explosion.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's a firecracker.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,We're living in a firecracker where it's,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,going to start emitting all kinds of interesting things.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And then the explosion doesn't, it might actually look like a little explosion, with with lights and fire and energy emitted all that kind of stuff.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"But when you look inside the details of the explosion, there's actual complexity happening, where there's like, yeah, human life or some kind of life.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"We hope it's not destructive firecracker, it's kind of like a constructive firecracker.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Alright, so given that, I think, hilarious, this guy does","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"a really interesting thing about like, what the puzzle of the universe is, did the creator of the universe, give us a message, like, for example, in the book, contact, Carl Sagan, there's a message for humanity, for any civilization in the digits in the expansion of pi and base 11, eventually, just kind of interesting thought, maybe, maybe we're supposed to be giving a message to our Creator, maybe we're supposed to somehow create some kind of a quantum mechanical system that alerts them to our intelligent presence here.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Because if you think about it, from their perspective, it just say like quantum field theory, massive like cellular automaton like thing, and like, how do you even notice that we exist, you might not even be able to pick us up in that simulation?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so how do you?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"How do you prove that you exist, that you're intelligent, and that you're part of the universe?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So this is like a Turing test for intelligence from Earth creators.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I mean, maybe this is like trying to complete the next word in the sentence, this is a complicated way of that, like Earth is just is basically sending a message back.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, the puzzle is basically like alerting the creator that we exist.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Or maybe the puzzle is just to just break out of the system and just, you know, stick it to the creator in some way.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Basically, like, if you're playing a video game, you can, you can somehow find an exploit and find a way to execute on the host machine.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,any arbitrary code.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"There's some, for example, I believe someone got Mario again with Mario to play Pong, just by exploiting it, and then creating a physical writing writing code and, and being able to execute arbitrary code in the game.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so maybe we should be maybe that's the puzzle is that we should be find a way to exploit it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So I think like some of these synthetic guys will eventually find the universe to be some kind of a puzzle, and then solve it in some way.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And that's kind of like the end game somehow.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Do you often think about it as, as a simulation?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So as or the universe being a kind of computation that has might have bugs and exploits?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I think so.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Isaac, physics is essential.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"

Lex Fridman,"Yeah, that's right.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And more like more and more sophisticated exploits, like these are jokes, but could be actually","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,find some way to extract an infinite energy.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"For example, when you train reinforcement learning agents, and physical simulations, and you ask them to say run quickly on the flat ground, they'll end up doing all kinds of like weird things.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"In part of that optimization, right?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"They'll get on their backlog, and they'll slide across the floor.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it's because of the optimization.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,The enforcement learning optimization on that agent has figured out a way to extract infinite energy from the friction forces and basically their poor implementation.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"

Lex Fridman,"Yeah, we'll figure out some kind of shortcut to some weirdness.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, and then see the problem.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"That weirdness is the first person to discover the weirdness, like sliding in the back legs.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"

Andrej Karpathy,"Well, no person will discover it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"

Lex Fridman,That doesn't feel like a deterministic thing.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"

Andrej Karpathy,"yeah, you're interpreting the choice.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"

Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And now we're talking about the narrative.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It's very meta.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Looking back, what is the most beautiful or surprising idea in deep learning or AI, in general that you've come across, you've seen this field explode, and grow in interesting ways.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Just what what cool ideas like, like waste made you sit back and go smart, big or small?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Well, the one that I've been thinking about recently, the most probably is the, the transformer architecture.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So basically, neural networks have a lot of architectures that were trendy have come and gone for different sensory modalities, like for vision, audio text, you would process them with different looking neural nets.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And recently, we've seen these, this convergence towards one architecture, the transformer, and you can feed it video or you can feed it, you know, images or speech or text and it just gobbles it up.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it's kind of like a bit of a general purpose computer.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,There's also trainable and very efficient to run on our hardware.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so this paper came out in 2016.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I want to say,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,attention is all you need attention is all you need.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"You criticize the paper title in retrospect, that it wasn't it didn't foresee the bigness of the impact that it was going to have you","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I'm not sure if the authors were aware of the impact that that paper would go on to half probably weren't, but I think they were aware of some of the motivations and design decisions behind the transformer and they chose not to, I think expand and that way in the paper, and so I think they had an idea that there was more than just the surface of just like overages during translation.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And here's a bit of architecture, you're not just doing translation.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,This is like a really cool differentiable optimizable efficient computer that you've proposed.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And maybe they didn't have all of that foresight, but I think is really interesting.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Isn't it funny Sorry to interrupt the that title is memorable that they went for such a profound idea.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"They went with a I don't think anyone use that kind of title before, right?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Attention is all you need.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, it's like a meme or something.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It's not funny.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,That one.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like, maybe it was a more serious talent.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Now the impact?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Honestly, I yeah, there is an element of me that honestly agrees with you and prefers it this way?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,If it was two grand it would over promise and under deliver potentially.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So you want to just mean your way to greatness.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,As you'd be a t shirt.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So you you tweeted the transformers and magnificent neural network architecture, because it is a general purpose differentiable computer, it is simultaneously expressive in the forward pass optimizable via proper backpropagation, gradient descent and efficient, high parallelism, compute graph, can you discuss some of those details expressive optimizable.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Efficient?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, from memory or, or in general, whatever comes to your heart,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"you want to have a general purpose computer that you can train on arbitrary problems, like say the task of next word prediction, or detecting if there's a cat in the image or something like that.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And you want to train this computer, so you want to set its weights.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I think there's a number of design criteria that sort of overlap in the transformer simultaneously, that made it very successful.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I think the authors were kind of deliberately trying to make this really powerful architecture.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so it basically it's very powerful in the forward pass, because it's able to express very general computation as a sort of something that looks like message passing, you have nodes, and they all store vectors.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And these nodes get to basically look at each other.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it's each other's vectors.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And they get to communicate.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And basically nodes get to broadcast, hey, I'm looking for certain things.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then other nodes get to broadcast Hey, these are the things I have, those are the keys and values.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So it's not just attention.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, exactly, transformer is much more than just the attention component.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's got many pieces architectural, that went into it, the residual connection of the way it's arranged, there's a multi layer perceptron in there, the way it's a stack, and so on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But basically, there's a message passing scheme where nodes get to look at each other, decide what's interesting, and then update each other.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so I think the, when you get to the details of it, I think it's a very expressive function.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So it can express lots of different types of algorithms and forward paths.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Not only that, but the way it's designed with the residual connections, layer normalizations, the softmax, attention and everything.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's also optimizable, this is a really big deal.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Because there's lots of computers that are powerful that you can optimize.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Or they're not easy to optimize using the techniques that we have, which is back propagation and gradient descent, these are first order methods, very simple optimizers, really, and so you also need it to be optimizable.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then lastly, you want it to run efficiently on our hardware, our hardware is a massive throughput machine, like GPUs, they prefer lots of parallelism.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So you don't want to do lots of sequential operations, you want to do a lot of operations serially, and the transformer is designed with that in mind as well.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so it's designed for our hardware, and it's designed to both be very expressive in a forward pass, but also very optimizable in the backward pass.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And you said that the residual connections support a kind of ability to learn short algorithms fast and first and then gradually extend them longer during training, what's what's the idea of learning short algorithms,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,right?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Think of it as so basically, a transformer is a series of blocks, right, and these blocks have attention and a little multi layer perceptron.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so you, you go off into a block, and you come back to this residual pathway, and then you go off and you come back, and then you have a number of layers arranged sequentially.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so the way to look at it, I think, is because of the residual pathway in the backward pass, the gradients sort of flow along it uninterrupted, because addition distributes the gradient equally to all of its branches.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So the gradient from the supervision at the top, just floats directly to the first layer.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And the all the residual connections are arranged so that in the beginning, during initialization, they contributed nothing to the residual pathway.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So what this kind of looks like is imagine the Transformers kind of like a Python function like a def.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And you get to do various kinds of lines of code.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So you have 100, layers deep transformer, typically they will be much shorter, say 20.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So if 20 lines of code, then you can do something in them.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so think during the optimization, basically, what it looks like is first you optimize the first line of code, and then the second line of code can kick in.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And the third line of code can can and I kind of feel like because of the residual pathway and the dynamics of the optimization.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"You can sort of learn a very short algorithm that gets the approximate answer, but then the other layers can sort of kick in and start to create a contribution.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And at the end of the year, you're optimizing over an algorithm that is 20 lines of code.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Except these lines of code are very complex because it's an entire block of a transformer you can do a lot in there.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Well, it's really interesting is that this transformer architecture actually has been remarkably resilient.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Basically, a transformer that came out in 2016 is the transformer you would use today except you reshuffle some Boolean norms.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,There really are normalizations have been reshuffled to a pre norm formulation.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so it's been remarkably stable.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But there's a lot of bells and whistles that people have attached to it and try to improve it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I do think that basically, it's a it's a big step in simultaneously optimizing for lots of properties of a desirable neural network architecture.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I think people have been trying to change it, but it's proven remarkably resilient.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But I do think that there should be even better pictures potentially.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,But it's your you admire the resilience here.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, there's something profound about this architecture that that least, maybe we can, everything can be turned into.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,into a problem that transformers can solve,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,currently definitely looks like the Transformers taking over AI.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And you can feed basically arbitrary problems into it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it's a general differentiable computer.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it's extremely powerful.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And this convergence in AI has been really interesting to watch.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,For me personally.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What else do you think could be discovered here about transformers?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Like what surprising thing?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Or is it a stable?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I wouldn't a stable place, there's something interesting, we might discover about transformers, like aha moments maybe has to do with memory, maybe knowledge representation, that kind of stuff?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Definitely does that guys today is just pushing, like, basically, right now these guys do not touch the transformer, and touch everything else.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So people are scaling up the datasets making them much, much bigger.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"They're working on the validation, making the evaluation much, much bigger.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And they're basically keeping the architecture unchanged.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And that's how we've done the last five years of progress in AI, kind of,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,what do you think about one flavor of it?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Which is language models?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Have you been surprised?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"has years of imagination been captivated by you mentioned GPT, and all the bigger and bigger and bigger language models?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And what are the limits?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Of those models?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Do you think?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So just the task of natural language.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Basically, the way GPT is trained, right, as you just don't a mass amount of text data from the internet.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And you try to predict the next word in a sequence, roughly speaking, you're predicting little word chunks.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But roughly speaking, that's it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And what's been really interesting to watch is, basically, it's a language model language models have actually existed for a very long time.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"There's papers on language modeling from 2003, even earlier,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,can you explain that case?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"What language model is,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"yeah, so language model, just basically, the rough idea is just predicting the next word in the sequence, roughly speaking.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So there's a paper from for example, Bengio, and the team from 2003, where for the first time, they were using a neural network to take say, like three or five words and predict the next word, and they're doing this on much smaller datasets, and the neural net is not a transformer.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's a multi layer perceptron.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But it's the first time that a neural network has been applied in that setting.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But even before neural networks, there were language models, except they were using Engram models.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So Engram models are just count based models.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So if you try to, if you start to take two words and predict the third one, you just count up how many times you've seen any two word combinations and what came next.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And what you predict is coming next is just what you've seen the most often the training set.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so luxury modeling has been around for a long time, neural networks have done language modeling for a long time.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So really, what's new or interesting or exciting is just realizing that when you scale it up with a powerful enough neural net transformer, you have all these emergent properties, where basically what happens is, if you have a large enough data set of text, you are in the task of predicting the next word, you are multitasking, a huge amount of different kinds of problems.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"You are multitasking, understanding of, you know, chemistry, physics, human nature, lots of things are sort of clustered in that objective.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's a very simple objective.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But actually, you have to understand a lot about the world to to make that prediction.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,You just said the EU word understanding.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Are you in terms of chemistry, and physics and so on?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What do you feel like it's doing is it's searching for the right context?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"In like, what is it?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What is the actual process happening here?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So basically, it gets 1000 words and is trying to predict the 1000.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And first, and in order to do that very, very well over the entire data set available on the internet, you actually have to basically kind of understand the context of, of what's going on in there.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And it's a sufficiently hard problem that you if you have a powerful enough computer, like a transformer, you end up with interesting solutions.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And you can ask it to I'll do all kinds ends of things.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And it shows a lot of emergent properties like in context learning, that was the big deal with GPT.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And the original paper when they published it is that you can just sort of prompt it in various ways and ask it to do various things.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it will just kind of complete the sentence.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But in the process of just completing the sentence, it's actually solving all kinds of really interesting problems that we care about.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Do you think he's doing something like understanding, like, and when we use the word understanding for us humans,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I think it's doing some understanding in its weights, it understands, I think a lot about the world.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it has to in order to predict the next word in the sequence.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So it's trained on the data from the internet.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"What do you think about this, this approach in terms of datasets of using data from the internet?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Do you think the internet has enough structured data to teach AI about human civilization?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yes, I think the internet has a huge amount of data.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I'm not sure if it's a complete enough set.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I don't know that text is enough for having a sufficiently powerful AGI as an outcome.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Of course, there is audio and video and images and all that kind of stuff.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So text by itself, I'm a little bit suspicious about there's a ton of things we don't put in text and writing, just because they're obvious to us about how the world works and the physics of it and that things fall, we don't put that stuff in text, because why would you, we share that understanding.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so text is a communication medium between humans.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it's not a all encompassing medium with knowledge about the world.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But as you pointed out, we do have video and we have images, and we've audio.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so I think that that definitely helps a lot.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But we haven't trained models sufficiently across both across all of those modalities yet.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So I think that's what a lot of people are interested in.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"But I wonder what that shared understanding of like, we might call common sense, has to be learned, Inferred in order to complete the sentence correctly.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So maybe the fact that it's implied on the internet, the model is going to have to learn that, not by reading about it by inferring it in the representation.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So like, common sense, just like we I don't think we learn common sense, like nobody says, tells us explicitly, we just figure it all out by interacting with the world, right?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So here's a model of reading about the way people interact with the world and might have to infer that.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I wonder, yeah, you you briefly worked on a project called the world of bits, training in our RL system to take actions on the internet, versus just consuming the internet, like we talked about, do you think there's a future for that kind of system interacting with the internet to help the learning?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yes, I think that's probably the the final frontier for a lot of these models, because it's so as you mentioned, when I was at opening, I was working on this project called of bits.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And basically, it was the idea of giving neural networks access to a keyboard and a mouse, and the idea of possibly","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,go wrong.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So basically, you, you perceive the inputs of the screen pixels.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And basically, the state of the computer is sort of visualized for human consumption in images of the web browser and stuff like that.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then you give the neural network the ability to press keyboards and use the mouse.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And we're trying to get it to, for example, complete bookings, and, you know, interact with user interfaces.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,would you learn from that experience?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like, what was some fun stuff?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,This is super cool idea.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I mean, it's like, yeah, I mean, the step between observer to actor Yeah, is a super fascinating stuff.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Well, it's the Universal Interface in the digital realm, I would say.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And there's a Universal Interface in like the physical realm, which in my mind is a humanoid form factor kind of thing.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"We can later talk about Optimus and so on, but I feel like there's a they're kind of like, similar philosophy in some way, where the human the world, the physical world is designed for the human form.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And the digital world is designed for the human form of seeing the screen and using keywords, not keyboard and mouse.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So as the Minister of Universal Interface that can basically command the digital infrastructure we've built up for ourselves.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so it feels like a very powerful interface to to command and to build on top of now to your question as to like what I learned from that it's interesting, because the world of bits was basically too early, I think, at open AI at the time.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,This is around 2015 or so.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And the zeitgeist at that time was very different in AI from the zeitgeist today.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"At the time, everyone was super excited about reinforcement learning from scratch.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"This is the time of the Atari paper, where neural networks were playing Atari Games, and beating humans in some cases, AlphaGo, and so on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So everyone's very excited about trading, training neural networks from scratch using reinforcement learning directly.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It turns out that Reinforcement learning is extremely inefficient way of training neural networks, because you're taking all these actions and all these observations and you get some sparse rewards once in a while.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So you do all this stuff based on all these inputs.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And once in a while, you're like told you did a good thing.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,You did a bad thing.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it's just an extremely hard problem.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,You can't learn from that you You can burn the forest.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And you can sort of brute force through it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And we saw that I think with, you know, with go and do it on so on and does work.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But it's extremely inefficient, and not how you want to approach problems practically speaking.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so that's the approach that at the time, we also took the world of bits, we would have an agent, initialized randomly, so with keyboard, mash, and mouse mash, and tried to make a booking, and it's just like revealed the insanity of that approach very quickly, where you have to stumble by the correct booking in order to get a reward of you did it correctly, and you're never gonna stumble by it, by chance at random.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So even with a simple web interface, there's too many options, there's just too many options.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And it's too sparse of reward signal, and you're starting from scratch at the time.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so you don't know how to read, you don't understand pictures, images, buttons, you don't understand what it means to like, make a booking.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But now what's happened is, it is time to revisit that and open your eyes interested in this.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Companies like adapt, are interested in this and so on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And the idea is coming back, because the interface is very powerful.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But now you're not training an agent from scratch, you are taking the GPT as initialization.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So GPT is pre trained on all of text.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And it understands what's a booking, it understands what's a submit, it understands quite a bit more.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so it already has those representations.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,They are very powerful.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And that makes all the training significantly more efficient.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And makes the problem tractable.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Should the interaction be with like the way humans see it with the buttons and the language?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Or should it be with HTML, JavaScript, and in the CSS, what's what do you think is the butter.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So today, all this interaction is mostly on the level of HTML, CSS, and so on?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,That's done because of computational constraints.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But I think ultimately, everything is designed for human visual consumption.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so at the end of the day, there's all the additional information is in the layout of the webpage, and what's next to you, and what's our red background, and all this kind of stuff, and not what it looks like visually.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So I think that's the final frontier as we're taking in pixels, and we're giving out the keyboard mouse commands.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But I think it's impractical still today,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,do you worry about bots on the internet?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Given given these ideas, given how exciting they are, I do worry about bots on Twitter being not the stupid boss that we see now with the crypto bots.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"But the bots that might be out there actually, we don't see that they're interacting in interesting ways.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So this kind of system feels like it should be able to pass the I'm not a robot click button, whatever.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,We do actually understand how that test works.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I don't quite like there's there's a there's a checkbox or whatever that you click is presumably tracking, like mouse movement, and the timing and so on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So exactly this kind of system we're talking about should be able to pass that.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So yeah, what do you feel about bots that are language models plus have some intractability and are able to tweet and reply and so on?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Do you worry about that world?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I think it's always been a bit of an arms race, between sort of the attack and the defense.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So the attacker will get stronger, but the defense will get stronger as well.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Our ability to detect that,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,how do you defend?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,How do you detect?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,How do you know that your Karpaty account on Twitter is human?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,How would you approach it?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like if people were claiming, you know?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,How would you defend yourself?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,In the court of law that I'm a human?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It's OCONUS.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"at some point, I think it might be, I think the society, society will evolve a little bit like we might start signing, digitally signing, some of our correspondents or, you know, things that we create.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Right now, it's not necessary, but maybe in the future it might be, I do think that we are going towards a world where we share, we share the digital space with AI's synthetic beings.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And they will get much better, and they will share our digital realm, and they'll eventually share our physical realm as well.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's much harder.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But that's kind of like the world we're going towards.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And most of them will be benign and awful.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And some of them will be malicious.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it's going to be an arms race trying to detect them.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So I mean, the worst isn't the AI is the worst is the AI is pretending to be human.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So I don't know if it's always malicious.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,There's obviously a lot of malicious applications.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"But yeah, it could also be, you know, if I was an AI, I would try very hard to pretend to be human because we're in a human world.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, I wouldn't get any respect as an AI.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, I want to get some love and respect.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I don't think,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,intractable people are thinking about the proof of personhood.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And we might start digitally signing our stuff.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And we might all end up having like, basically some some solution for proof of personhood.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It doesn't seem to me and tractable.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's just something that we haven't had to do until now.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But I think once the need like really starts to emerge, which is soon, I think when people think about it much more.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So but that too will be a race because obviously you can probably spoof or fake the proof of personhood.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It seems to try to figure out how to probably.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I mean, it's weird that we have like social security numbers and like passports and stuff.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It seems like it's harder to fake stuff in the physical space.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"In the digital space, it just feels like it's gonna be very tricky.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Very tricky to out.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Because it seems to be pretty low cost to fake stuff.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What are you gonna put an AI in jail?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"For, like trying to use a fake fake personhood proof?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, I mean, okay, fine, you put a lot of guys in jail.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"But there'll be more as arbitrary, like exponentially more, the cost of creating bot is very low.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Unless there's some kind of way to track accurately.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like, you're not allowed to create any program without showing, tying yourself to that program.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like you any program that runs on the internet, you'll be able to trace every single human programming that was involved with that product.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And maybe you have to start declaring when, you know, we have to start drawing those boundaries and keeping track of okay, what are digital entities versus human entities?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And what are the ownership of human entities and digital entities and something like that?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I don't know.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But I think I'm optimistic that this is this is possible.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And at some, in some sense, we're currently in like the worst time of it, because all these bots suddenly have become very capable.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But we don't have the fences yet built up as a society.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And but I think that doesn't seem to me intractable it just something that we have to deal with.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It seems weird that the twitter bot, like really crappy Twitter bots, are so numerous, I guess, is it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So I presume that the engineers at Twitter are very good.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So it seems like what I would infer from that is, it seems like a hard problem, it they're probably catching, if I were to sort of steal man the case.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It's a hard problem.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And there's a huge cost to false positive, to, to removing a post by somebody, that's not a bot.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,That's creates a very bad user experience.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So they're very cautious about removing the maybes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And maybe the bots are really good at learning what gets removed and not such that they can stay ahead of the removal process very quickly.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"My impression of it honestly, is there's a lot of low hanging fruit.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I mean, just that's what I it's not my impression, it's not","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,what you have.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, that's my impression as well.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,But it feels like maybe you're seeing the the tip of the iceberg.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Maybe the number of bots is in like the trillions.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And you have to like, just it's a constant assault of bots.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And you Yeah, I don't know.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"You have to assume in that case, because the bots I'm seeing are pretty, like obvious, I can write a few lines of code that catch these bots.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I mean, definitely, there's a lot of low hanging fruit.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But I will say I agree that if you are a sophisticated actor, you could probably create a pretty good bar right now.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"You know, using tools like GPS, because it's a language model, you can generate faces that look quite good now.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And you can do this at scale.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so I think it's quite possible, it's going to be hard to defend.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,There was a Google engineer that claimed that the lambda was essential.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Do you think there's any inkling of truth to what he felt?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And more importantly, to me, at least, do you think language models will achieve sentience or the illusion of sentience?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,soonish?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Ish?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, to me, it's a little bit of a canary in the coal mine kind of moment, honestly, a little bit, because so this engineer spoke to like a chatbot at Google, and became convinced that this bot is sentient, asked us some existential philosophical question and gave like reasonable answers and looked real, and, and so on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So to me, it's a he was he was, he wasn't sufficiently trying to stress the system, I think and exposing the truth of it, as it is today.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But I think this will be increasingly harder over time.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So yeah, I think more and more people will basically become Yeah, I think more and more, there will be more people like that.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Over time.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"As this gets better,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,like forming emotional connection to an AI.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It's perfectly plausible, in","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"my mind, I think these AIs are actually quite good at human human connection, human emotion, a ton of text on the internet is about humans and connection and love and so on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So I think they have a very good understanding in some, in some sense of, of how people speak to each other about this.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And they're very capable of creating a lot of that kind of text.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,The there's a lot of like sci fi from 50s and 60s that imagined AI is in a very different way.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"They are calculating coal Vulcan like machines, that's not what we're getting today, we're getting pretty emotional AI, that actually are very competent and capable of generating, you know, plausible sounding text with respect to all of these topics.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"See, I'm","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"really hopeful about AI systems that are like companions that help you grow, develop as a human being, help you maximize long term happiness.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"But I'm also very worried about AI systems that figure out from the internet, that humans get attracted to drama.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So these would just be like shit talking to you guys.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,That just constant Did you hear?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like, they'll do gossip?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,They'll do.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"They'll try to plant seeds of suspicion to other humans that you love and trust, and just kind of mess with people in you know, because because that's going to get a lot of attention to drama, maximize drama, on the path to maximizing engagement, and as humans will feed into that machine.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And get it'd be a giant drama shitstorm.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So I'm worried about that.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So is the objective function really defines the way that human civilization progresses with AI, isn't it?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I think right now, at least today, they're not sort of, it's not correct to really think of them as goal seeking agents that want to do something, they have no long term memory or anything, they it's literally a good approximation of it is, you get 1000 words, and you're trying to predict the 1,001st.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then you continue feeding it in, and you are free to prompt it in whatever way you want.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So in text, so you say, Okay, you are a psychologist, and you are very good, and you love humans.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And here's a conversation between you and another human, human, Colin something, you something.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then it just continues the pattern.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And suddenly, you're having a conversation with a fake psychologist who's like trying to help you.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so it's still kind of like an aroma of a tool is a people can prompt it an arbitrary waste, and it can create really incredible text.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But it doesn't have long term goals over long periods of time, it doesn't try to sort of doesn't look that way right now.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,But you can do short term goals that have long term effects.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So if my prompting, short term goal is to get onto a capacitor respond to me on Twitter, when I like, I think AI might that's the goal, but you might figure out the talking shit to you, it would be the best in a highly sophisticated, interesting way.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And then you build up a relationship when you respond once and then it like, over time, it gets to not be sophisticated and just like, just talk shit.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Okay, maybe you won't get to Andre, but it might get to another celebrity and might get into other big accounts.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And then it'll just so with just that simple goal.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Get them to respond.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, maximize the probability of actual response.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, I","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"mean, you could prompt a powerful model like this with their its opinion about how to do any possible thing you interested in it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So they will just they're kind of on track to become these Oracle's I could sort of think of it that way.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,They are.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Oracle's currently is just text, but they will have calculators, they will have access to Google search, they will have all kinds of gadgets and gizmos, they will be able to operate the internet and find different information.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And yeah, in some sense, that's kind of like currently what it looks like in terms of the development, do you think it'll","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"be an improvement eventually over what Google is for access to human knowledge, like, it'll be a more effective search engine to access human knowledge.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I think there's definite scope and building a better search engine today.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I think Google, they have all the tools, all the people, they have everything, they need all the puzzle pieces, they have people training transformers, at scale, they have all the data.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's just not obviously they are capable as an organization to innovate on their search engine right now.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And if they don't, someone else will, there's absolute scope for building a significantly better search engine built on these tools","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"is so interesting, a large company, where the search, there's already an infrastructure, it works as brings out a lot of money.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So where structurally inside a company is their motivation to pivot.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, to say, we're going to build a new search engine.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yep.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,That's hard.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It's usually going to come from a startup, right?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"That's, that would be Yeah, or some other common more competent organization.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So currently, for example, maybe being has another shot at it, you know, as an","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"NGO, Microsoft ventures were talking offline.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I mean, it definitely is really interesting, because search engines used to be about, okay, here's some query, here's, here's, here's web pages that look like the stuff that you have.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But you could just directly go to answer and then have supporting evidence.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And these, these models, basically, they've read all the texts and they've read all the web pages.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so sometimes when you see yourself going over to search results and sort of getting like a sense of like the average answer to whatever you're interested in, like that just directly comes out.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,You don't have to do that work.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So they're kind of like Yeah, I think they have a way to this of distilling all that knowledge into, like some level of insight basically,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,do you think of prompting as a kind of teaching and learning?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Like this whole process?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Like another layer?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"You know, because maybe that's what humans are already have that background model and then your, the world is prompting you.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, exactly.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I think the way we are programming these computers now, like GPS is converging to how you program humans.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I mean, how do I program humans via prompt, I go to people and I prompt them to do things, I prompt them from information.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so natural language prompt is how we program humans.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And we're starting to program computers directly in that interface.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's like pretty remarkable, honestly.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So you've spoken a lot about the idea of software 2.0.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"All good ideas, become like cliches so quickly, like the terms it's kind of hilarious.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It's like, I think Eminem once said that, like, if he gets annoyed by song he's written very quickly, that means it's going to be a big hit, because it's too catchy.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,But can you describe this idea and how you're thinking about it has evolved over the months and years?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Since?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Since you coined it?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yes, I had a blog post on software 2.0, I think several years ago now.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And the reason I wrote that post is because I kept, I kind of saw something remarkable happening in like software development, and how a lot of code was being transitioned to be written not in sort of like C++ and so on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But it's written in the weights of a neural net, basically just saying that neural nets are taking over software, they're almost software and taking more more and more tasks.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And at the time, I think not many people understood this, deeply enough that this is a big deal.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's a big transition.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Neural networks were seen as one of multiple classification algorithms you might use for your data set problem on Kaggle.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Like, this is not that this is a change in how we program computers.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I saw neural nets as this is going to takeover, the way we program computers is going to change, it's not going to be people writing a software in C++ or something like that, and directly programming the software, it's going to be accumulating training sets and datasets, and crafting these objectives by which we train these neural nets.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And at some point, there's going to be a compilation process from the datasets and the objective and the architecture specification into the binary, which is really just the neural net weights and the forward pass of the neural net.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then you can deploy that binary.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So I was talking about that sort of transition.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And that's what the post is about.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I saw this sort of play out in a lot of fields.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"You know, autopilot, autopilot being one of them, but also just simple image classification, people thought, originally, you know, in the 80s, and so on that they would write the algorithm for detecting a dog and an image.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And they had all these ideas about how the brain does it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And first we did tech corners, and then we detect lines, and then we stitch them up.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And they were like really going at it, they were like thinking about how they're going to write the algorithm.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And this is not the way you build it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And there was a smooth transition where, okay, first, we thought we were going to build everything, then we were building the features.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So like Hawk features, and things like that, that detect these little statistical patterns from image patches.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then there was a little bit of learning on top of it, like a support vector machine, or binary classifier for cat versus dog and images on top of the features.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So we wrote the features, but we trained the last layer as sort of the the classifier, and then people are like, actually, let's not even design the features, because we can't, honestly, we're not very good at it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So let's also learn the features.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then you end up with basically a convolutional neural net, where you're learning most of it, you're just specifying the architecture.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And the architecture has tons of fill in the blanks, which has all the knobs, and you let the optimization write most of it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so this transition is happening across the industry everywhere.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And suddenly, we end up with a ton of code that is written in neural net weights.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I was just pointing out that the analogy is actually pretty strong.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And we have a lot of developer environments for software 1.0, like we have IDE is how you work with code, how you debug code, how do you how you run code, how do you maintain code, we have GitHub.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So I was trying to make those analogies in the new realm.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Like what is the GitHub or software?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It turns out that something that looks like hugging face right now?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"You know, and so I think some people took it seriously and build cool companies, and many people originally attacked the post.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It actually was not well received when I wrote it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I think maybe it has something to do with the title.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But the post was not well received.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I think more people sort of have been coming around to it over time.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So you were the director of AI at Tesla, where I think this idea was really implemented at scale, which is how you have engineering teams doing software 2.0.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So can you sort of linger on that idea of?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I think we're in the really early stages of everything you just said, which is like GitHub, I IDs?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like how do we build engineering teams that, that work in software 2.0 system and the data collection and the data annotation?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Which is all part of that software?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,2.0?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like, what do you think?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Is the task of programming software?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,2.0?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Is it debugging in the space of hyperparameters?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Or is it also the bug in the space of data?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, the way by which you program the computer and influence its algorithm is not by writing the commands yourself, you're changing mostly the dataset, you're changing the loss functions of like, what the neural net is trying to do, how it's trying to predict things, but they're basically the assets and the architecture of the neural net.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so in the case of the autopilot, a lot of the datasets have to do with, for example, detection of objects, and lane line markings, and traffic lights, and so on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So you accumulate Massive Datasets of, here's an example.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Here's the desired label.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then, here's roughly how the architecture, here's roughly what the algorithm should look like.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And that's accomplished on neural net.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So the specification of the architecture is like a hint as to what the algorithm should roughly look like.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then the fill in the blanks process of optimization is the training process.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then you take your neural net that was trained, it gets all the right answers on your data set, and you deploy it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So there's, in that case, perhaps in all, machine learning cases, there's a lot of tasks.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So is coming up formulating a task, like for a multi 100 neural network is formulating a task part of the programming.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, very much.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So how you break down a problem into a set of tasks?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I'm gonna high level, I would say, if you look at the software running in the autopilot, I gave a number of talks on this topic, I would say originally, a lot of it was written in software, 1.0, there's imagine lots of C++, right?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then gradually, there was a tiny neural net that was, for example, predicting, given a single image, is there like a traffic light or not?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Or is there a lane line marking or not.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And this neural net didn't have too much to do in this in the scope of the software, it was making tiny predictions on individual little image, and then the rest of the system stitched it up.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So okay, we're actually we don't have just a single camera with eight cameras, we actually have eight cameras over time.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So what do you do with these predictions?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,How do you put them together?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,How do you do the fusion of all that information?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And how do you act on it, all of that was written by humans in C++.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then we decided, okay, we don't actually want to do all of that fusion in C++ code, because we're actually not good enough to write that algorithm, we want the neural nets to write the algorithm.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And we want to port all that software into the two panels stack.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so then we actually had neural nets that now take all the eight camera images simultaneously and make predictions for all of that, also.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And, actually, they don't make predictions in the in the space of images, they now make predictions directly in 3d.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And actually, they don't, in three dimensions around the car.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And now actually, we don't manually fuse the predictions over in 3d Over time, we don't trust ourselves to write that tracker.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So actually, we give the neural net the information over time.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So it takes these videos now, and makes us predictions.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so we're starting just like putting more and more power to the neural network processing.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And at the end of it, the eventual sort of goal is to have most of the software potentially be enough to Panola.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And because it works significantly better, humans are just not very good at writing software, basically.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So the prediction is happening in this, like four D Land was three dimensional world over time.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,How do you do annotation in that world?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What have you.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So data annotation, whether it's self supervised, or manual, by humans, is, is a big part of this ultra 2.0?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,World?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Right?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I would say by far in the industry, if you're like talking about the industry, and how, what is the technology of what we have available, everything is supervised learning.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So you need a datasets of input desired output, and you need lots of it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And there are three properties of it that you need, you need it to be very large, you need it to be accurate, no mistakes, and you needed to be diverse, you don't want to just have a lot of correct examples of one thing, you need to really cover the space of possibility as much as you can.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And the more you can cover the space of possible inputs, the better the algorithm will work at the end.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Now, once you have really good datasets that you're collecting, curating, and cleaning, you can train your neural net on top of that, so a lot of the work goes into clean those datasets.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Now, as you pointed out, it's probably it could be the question is how do you achieve a tariff.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,If you want to basically predict in 3d you need data in 3d to back that up.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So in this video, we have eight videos coming from all the cameras of the system.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And this is what they saw.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And this is the truth of what actually was round.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,There was this card there was this car this car.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,These are lane line markings.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,This is geometry.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"The road, there's traffic light in this three dimensional position, you need the ground truth.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so the big question that team was solving, of course is how do you how do you arrive at that ground truth, because once you have a million of it, and it's large, clean and diverse than training a neural net on it works extremely well.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And you can ship that into the car.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so there's many mechanisms by which we collected that train data, you can always go for human annotation, you can go for simulation as a source of ground truth, you can also go for what we call the offline tracker, that we spoken about at the AI day, and so on, which is basically an automatic reconstruction process for taking those videos and recovering the three dimensional sort of reality of what was around that car.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So basically, think of doing like a three dimensional reconstruction as an offline thing.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then understanding that, okay, there's 10 seconds of video, this is what we saw.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And therefore, here's a willing last cars and so on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then once you have that annotation, you can train a neural net to imitate it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And how difficult to reconstruct the 3d reconstruction is difficult.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,But it can be done.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So there's the there's overlap between the cameras, and you do the reconstruction.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And there's perhaps there's any inaccuracy.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So that's called an annotation step.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Oh, yes, the nice thing about the annotation is that it is fully offline, you have infinite time, you have a chunk of one minute, and you're trying to just offline in a supercomputer somewhere, figure out where were the positions of all the cars, all the people, and you have your full one minute video from all the angles, and you can run all the neural nets you want.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And they can be very efficient, massive neural nets.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,That can be neural nets that can't even run in the car later at test time.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So they can be even more powerful neural nets than what you can eventually deploy.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So you can do anything you want three dimensional reconstruction, neural nets, anything you want just to recover that truth.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then you supervise that truth.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What have you learned?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"You said, No mistakes about humans doing annotation?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Because I assume humans are.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,There's like a range of things that are good at in terms of clicking stuff on screen.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Isn't that?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"How interesting is that you have a problem of designing an annotator where humans are accurate, enjoy it, like what are the even the metrics are efficient or productive?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,All that kind of stuff?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, so I grew the annotation team at Tesla from Bisca, zero to 1000.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"While I was there, that was really interesting, in my background, as a PhD student researcher, so growing that company organization was pretty crazy.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But yeah, I think it's extremely interesting and part of the design process very much behind the autopilot as to where you use humans, humans are very good at certain kinds of annotations.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"They're very good, for example, a two dimensional annotations of images, they're not good at annotating cars over time and three dimensional space very, very hard.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so that's why we were very careful to design the tasks that are easy to do for humans, versus things that should be left to the off on tracker, like maybe the maybe the computer will do all the triangulation and 3d reconstruction.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But the human will say exactly these pixels of the image are car.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,exactly these pixels are human.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so co designing the data annotation pipeline was very much bread and butter was what I was doing daily,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,do you think there's still a lot of open problems in that space?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Just in general annotation, where the stuff the machines are good at machines do and the humans do what they're good at.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And there's maybe some iterative process,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,right?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I think, to a very large extent, we went through a number of iterations.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And we learned a ton about how to create these datasets.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I'm not seeing big open problems.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Like originally, when I joined, I was like, I was really not sure how this will turn out here.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But by the time I left, I was much more secure.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And actually, we sort of understand the philosophy of how to create these datasets.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I was pretty comfortable with where that was at the time.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So what are strengths and limitations of cameras for the driving task and your understanding, when you formulate the driving task as a vision task with eight cameras, you've seen that the entire you know, most of the history of the computer vision field when it has to do with neural networks.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"What just if you step back, what are the strengths and limitations of pixels of using pixels to drive?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, pixels, I think are a beautiful sensory, beautiful sensor, I would say things like cameras are very, very cheap.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And they provide a ton of information ton of bits.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Also, it's a extremely cheap sensor for a ton of bits.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And each one of these bits as a constraint on the state of the world.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so you get lots of megapixel images, very cheap.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it just gives you all these constraints for understanding what's actually out there in the world.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So vision is probably the highest bandwidth sensor.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's a very high bandwidth sensor.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I love it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I love the pixels is is a constraint on the world, as is highly complex, high bandwidth constraint on the war on the state of the world.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's not just that but again, this real real importance of it's the sensor that humans use.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Therefore everything is designed for that sensor attacks, the writing the flashing signs, everything is designed for vision.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so if you just find it everywhere, and so that's why that is the interface, you want to be in talking again about these universal interfaces.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And that's where we actually want to measure the world as well, and then develop software for that sensor.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,But there's other constraints on the state of the world that humans use to understand the world.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I mean, vision, ultimately, is the main one.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"But we're like, we're like, referencing our understanding of human behavior and some common sense, physics, that could be inferred from vision from, from a perception perspective, but it feels like we're using some kind of reasoning to predict the world.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, and not just the pixels, I mean, you have a powerful prior, so right, for how the world evolves over time, etc.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So it's not just about the likelihood term, coming up from the data itself, telling you about what you are observing, but also the prior term of like, where are the likely things to see and how do they likely move and so on?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And the question is, how complex is the the the range of possibilities that might happen in the driving task?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Right, there still, is that you still an open problem of how difficult is driving, like, philosophically speaking?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Do you work on driving?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Do you understand how hard driving is?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, driving is really hard.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Because it has to do with the predictions of all these other agents and the theory of mind, and you know, what they're gonna do?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And are they looking at you?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Are they where are they looking?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Where are they thinking?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, there's a lot that goes there, at the full tail off, you know, the, the expansion of the knowledge that we have to be comfortable with it eventually, the final problems are of that form.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I don't think those are the problems that are very common.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I think, eventually, they're important, but it's like really, in the tail end,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"in the tail end, the rare edge cases.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"From the vision perspective, what are the toughest parts of the vision problem of driving?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Well, basically, the sensor is extremely powerful, but you still need to process that information.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so going from brightnesses of these pixel values to Hey, here, the three dimensional world is extremely hard.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And that's what the neural networks are fundamentally doing.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so the difficulty really is in just doing an extremely good job of engineering the entire pipeline, the entire data engine, having the capacity to train these neural nets, having the ability to evaluate the system, and iterate on it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So I would say just doing this in production at scale is like the hard part.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's an execution problem.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So the data,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"engineering, but also the the sort of deployment of the system such that has low latency performance, so as to do all the steps","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"for the neural net, specifically, just making sure everything fits into the chip on the car.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And you have a finite budget of flops that you can perform, and, and memory bandwidth and other constraints.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And you have to make sure it applies.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And you can squeeze in as much compute as you can into the tiny,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What have you learned from that process?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Because it may be that's one of the bigger like, new things coming from a research background, where there's there's a system that has to run under heavily constrained resources has to run really fast.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What What kind of insights have you learned from that?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I'm not sure if it's if there's too many insights, you're trying to create a neural nets that will fit in what you have available.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And you're always trying to optimize it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And we talked a lot about it on the AI day, and basically, the the triple backflips, that the team is doing, to make sure it all fits and utilizes the engine.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So I think it's extremely good engineering.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then there's all kinds of little insights peppered in on how to do it properly.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Let's actually zoom out because I don't think we talked about the data engine, the entirety of the layout of this idea that I think it's just beautiful with humans in the loop.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Can you describe the data engine?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, the data engine is what I call the almost biological feeling like process by which you have perfect the training sets for these neural networks.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So because most of the programming now is in the level of these datasets, and make sure they're large, diverse and clean, basically, you have a data set that you think is good, you train your neural net, you deploy it, and then you observe how well it's performing.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And you're trying to always increase the quality of your dataset.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So you're trying to catch scenarios, basically, that are basically rare.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it is in these scenarios that neural nets will typically struggling because they weren't told what to do in those rare cases in the dataset.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But now you can close the loop because if you can now collect all those at scale, you can then feed them back into the reconstruction process I described and reconstruct the truth in those cases and add it to the dataset.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So the whole thing ends up being like a staircase of improvement of perfecting your training set.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And you have to go through deployments so that you can mine the parts that are not the It represented well in the data set.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So your data set is basically imperfect, it needs to be diverse, it has pockets that are missing, and you need to pad out the pockets, you can sort of think of it that way.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"In the data,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,what role do humans play in this?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So what's the this biological system?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Like?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,A human body is made up of cells?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What role?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like how you optimize the human system, the multiple engineers collaborating, figuring out?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What to focus on?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What to contribute?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Which, which task to optimize in this neural network?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Who's in charge of figuring out which task needs more data?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What can you do?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Can you speak to the hyper parameters, the human system,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,it really just comes down to extremely good execution from an engineering team who knows what they're doing.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"They understand intuitively, the physical philosophical insights underlying the data engine and the process by which the system improves, and how to again, like delegate the strategy of the data collection, and how that works.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then just making sure it's all extremely well executed.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And that's where most of the work is not even the philosophizing or the research or the ideas of it is just extremely good execution is so hard when you're dealing with data at that scale.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So your role in the data engine executing well on it is difficult and extremely important.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Is there a priority of like, like a vision board of saying, like, we really need to get better at stoplights.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like the prioritization of tasks is essentially, in that comes from the data","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"that comes to the larger extents to what we are trying to achieve in the product roadmap, or we're trying to the release, we're trying to get out in the feedback from the QA team, or where the system is struggling or not the things we're trying to","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,improve.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And the QA team gives some signal, some information in aggregate about the performance of the system and various conditions.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then of course, all of us drive it, and we can also see it, it's really nice to work with a system that you can also experience yourself.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And you know, it drives you home, it's","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Is there some insight you can draw from your individual experience that you just can't quite get from an aggregate statistical analysis of data?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, it's so weird, right?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It's, it's not scientific, in a sense, because you're just one anecdotal sample?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I think there's a ton of it's a source of truth, it's your interaction with the system.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And you can see it, you can play with it, you can perturb it, you can get a sense of it, you have an intuition for it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I think numbers just like have a way of numbers and plots and graphs are much harder.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It hides a lot of,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"it's like, if you train in language model, it's really powerful way is by you interacting with it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"100%, I try to build up an intuition.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I think like Elon also, like he always wanted to drive this the system himself, he drives a lot.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I want to say almost daily.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So he also sees this as a source of truth, you driving the system, and it performing?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,what do you think?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Tough questions here.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So Tesla last year, removed radar from from the sensor suite, and now just announced that it's going to remove all ultrasonic sensors, relying solely on vision.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So camera only?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Does that make the perception problem harder or easier?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I would almost reframe the question in some way.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So the thing is, basically, you would think that additional sensors,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"by the way, can I just interrupt God, I wonder if language model ever do that?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"If you prompt it, let me rephrase your question.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,be epic.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,This is the wrong problem.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Sorry,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,like a little bit of a wrong question.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Because basically, you would think that these sensors are an asset to you.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But if you fully consider the entire product in its entirety, the sensors are actually potentially a liability.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Because the sensors aren't free, they don't just appear on your car, you need something you need have an entire supply chain, you have people procuring it, there can be problems with them, they may need replacement, they are part of the manufacturing process, they can hold back the line in production, you need to source them, you need to maintain them, you have to have teams that write the firmware, all of all of it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then you also have to incorporate them fuse them into the system in some way.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so it actually like bloats, the, the a lot of it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I think Elon is really good at Simplify, simplify best part is no part.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And he always tries to throw away things that are not essential because he understands the entropy in organizations and an approach.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I think, in this case, the cost is high, and you're not potentially seeing it if you're just a computer vision engineer, and I'm just trying to improve my network.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And is it more useful or less useful?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,How useful is it?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And the thing is, if once you consider the full cost of a sensor, it actually is potentially a liability.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And you need to be really sure that it's giving you extremely useful information.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"In this case, we looked at using it or not using it and the Delta was not massive, and so it's not useful.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Is it,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"also bloat in the data engine like having more sense understand and is a distraction and the sensors you know, they can change over time.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"For example, you can have one type of say radar you can have Another type of radar that change over time, now suddenly you need to worry about it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Now suddenly you have a column in your SQLite telling you Oh, what sensor type was it, and they all have different distributions.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then they can just be contributed noise and entropy into everything.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And they bloat stuff.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And also, organizationally has been really fascinating to me that it can be very distracting.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"If you if, if you only want to get to work as vision, all the resources are on it, and you're building out a data engine.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And you're actually making forward progress, because that is the the sensor with the most bandwidth, the most constraints on the world.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And you're investing fully into that.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And you can make that extremely good if you're using only a finite amount of sort of spend off focus across different facets of the system.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And this kind of reminds me of rich Sutton's a better lesson.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,That just seems like simplifying the system in the long run.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Now, of course, you know, know what the long route is, seems to be always the right solution.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, yes, in that case was for URL, but it seems to apply generally, across all systems that do computation.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So where, what do you think about the LIDAR as a crutch debate?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,The battle between point clouds and pixels?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I think this debate is always like, slightly confusing to me.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Because it seems like the actual debate should be about like, do you have the fleet or not?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"That's like, the really important thing about whether you can achieve a really good functioning of an AI system at this scale?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So data collection systems?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"do you have a fleet or not, is significantly more important, whether you have LIDAR or not, it's just another sensor?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And yeah, I think, similar to or the radar discussion, basically, I don't think it it basically doesn't offer extra extra information.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's extremely costly, it has all kinds of problems, you have to worry about it, you have to calibrate it, etc.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It creates bloat and entropy, you have to be really sure that you need this, this sensor.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"In this case, I basically don't think you need it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I think, honestly, I will make a stronger statement.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I think the others, some of the other companies who are using it are probably going to drop it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So you have to consider the sensor in the full in considering, can you build a big fleet that collects a lot of data?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And can you integrate that sensor with that data and that sensor into a data engine that's able to quickly find different parts of the data that then continuously improves whatever the model that you're using?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, another way to look at it is like, vision is necessary in the sense that the drive, the world is designed for human visual consumption.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So you need vision, it's necessary.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then also, it is sufficient, because it has all the information that you that you need for driving, and humans obviously has a vision to drive.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So it's both necessary and sufficient.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So you want to focus resources, and you have to be really sure if you're going to bring in other sensors, you could you could you could add sensors to infinity, at some point, you need to draw the line.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I think in this case, you have to really consider the full cost of any one sensor that you're adopting.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And do you really need it?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I think the answer in this case is no.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So what do you think about the idea that that the other companies are forming high resolution maps and constraining heavily the geographic regions in which they operate?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Is that approach not in your, in your view, not going to scale over time to the entirety of the United States?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I think thing, as you mentioned, like they pre map all the environments, and they need to refresh the map, and they have a perfect centimeter level accuracy map of everywhere they're going to drive.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's crazy.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"How are you going to we've been talking about the economy actually changing the world, we're talking about the deployment, on a on a global scale of autonomous systems for transportation.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And if you need to maintain a centimeter accurate map for Earth, or like for many cities and keep them updated, it's a huge dependency that you're taking on huge dependency.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's a massive, massive dependency.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And now you need to ask yourself, do you really need it?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And humans don't need it?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Right.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So it's, it's very useful to have a low level map of like, okay, the connectivity of your road, you know, that there's a fork coming up.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"When you drive an environment, you sort of have that high level understanding.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's like a small Google Map.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And Tesla uses Google Map, like similar kind of resolution information in the system, but it will not pre map environments.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So somebody sent me a lot of accuracy.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's a crutch, it's a distraction.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It costs entropy.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And it diffuses the team and dilutes the team, and you're not focusing on what's actually necessary, which is computer vision problem.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"What did you learn about machine learning, about engineering about life about yourself as one human being?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,From working with Elon Musk?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I think the most I've learned is about how to sort of run organizations efficiently and how to create efficient organizations and how to fight entropy in an organization.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So human engineering in the fight against entropy.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"there's a there's a, I think Elon is a very efficient warrior, in the fight against entropy in organizations.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What is the entropy in an organization look like?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Exactly.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's process.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's It's process and in efficiencies and inefficiencies and that kind of stuff, yeah, meetings, he hates meetings.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,He keeps telling people to skip meetings if they're not useful.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,He basically runs the world's biggest startups.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I would say, Tesla, SpaceX are the world's biggest startups.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Tesla actually has multiple startups.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I think it's better to look at it that way.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so I think he's, he's extremely good at at that.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And, yeah, it's a very good intuition for streamlining processes, making everything efficient.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Best part is no part simplifying, focusing.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And just kind of removing barriers, moving very quickly, making big moves.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"All this is a very startup B, sort of seeming things, but at scale,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"so strong drive to simplify from, from your perspective, I mean, that that also probably applies to just designing systems and machine learning.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And otherwise, yeah, like, simplify, simplify, yes.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What do you think is the secret to maintaining the startup culture in a company that grows?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Is there can you introspect that?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I do think you need someone in a powerful position with a big hammer, like Elon, who's like the cheerleader for that idea, and ruthlessly, ruthlessly pursues it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,If no one has a big enough hammer.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Everything turns into committee's democracy within the company, process, talking to stakeholders decision making just everything just crumbles.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"If you have a big person who is also really smart, that has a big hammer, things move quickly.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So you said your favorite scene Interstellar is the intense docking scene with the AI and Cooper talking saying, Cooper, what are you doing?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Docking?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It's not possible?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"No, it's necessary.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Such a good line.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"By the way, just so many questions there.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Why in the AI, in that scene, presumably is supposed to be able to compute a lot more than the human is saying it's not optimal.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Why the human?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I mean, that's a movie, but shouldn't they I know much better than the human.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Anyway, what do you think is the value of setting seemingly impossible goals?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So like?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Our initial intuition, which seems like something that you have taken on, and Elon espouses that, where the initial intuition of the community might say, this is very difficult, and then you take it on anyway, with a crazy deadline?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,You just from a human engineering perspective?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Have you seen the value of that?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I wouldn't say that setting impossible goals exactly is a good idea.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But I think setting very ambitious goals is a good idea.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I think there's a, what I call sublinear scaling of difficulty, which means that 10x problems are not 10x, hard, usually 10x 10x, harder problem is like two or 3x, harder to execute on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Because if you want to actually like if you want to improve a system by 10%, it costs some amount of work.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And if you want to 10x improve the system, it doesn't cost, you know, 100x amount of the work.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it's because you fundamentally change the approach.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And if you start with that constraint, that some approaches are obviously dumb and not going to work, and it forces you to reevaluate.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I think it's a very interesting way of approaching problem solving.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It requires a weird kind of thinking, just going back to your like PhD days, is like, how do you think which ideas in the machine learning community are solvable?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yes, it's a it requires.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What is that?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I mean, there's the cliche of first principles thinking but like, it requires to basically ignore what the community is saying, because doesn't the community doesn't a community in science usually draw lines of what isn't as impossible, right?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And like, it's very hard to break out of that without going crazy.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yep.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I mean, I think a good example here is, you know, the deep learning revolution in some sense, because you could be in computer vision at that time, when, during the deep learning, sort of revolution of 2012, and so on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,You could be improving a computer vision stack by 10%.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Or it can just be saying, Actually, all this is useless.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And how do I do 10x?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Better computer vision?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Well, it's not probably by tuning a hog feature detector, I need a different approach.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I need something that is scalable, going back to Richard Sutton's.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And understanding sort of like the philosophy of the bitter lesson, and then being like, actually, I need much more scalable system like a neural network that in principle works, and then having some deep believers that can actually execute on that mission and make it work.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So that's the tech solution.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What do you think is the timeline to solve the problem of autonomous driving?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"This still, in part, an open question?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I think the tough thing with timelines of self driving, obviously, is that no one has created self driving.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So it's not like what do you think is the timeline to build this bridge?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Well, we've built million bridges before.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Here's how long that takes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's, it's a no one has built autonomy.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's not obvious Some parts turned out to be much easier than others.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So it's really hard to forecast you do your best based on trend lines and so on.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And based on intuition, but that's why fundamentally, it's just really hard to forecast this.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,No one is even still,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,like being inside of it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It's hard to, to","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yes, some things turn out to be much harder, and some things turn out to be much easier.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Do you,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,try to avoid making forecasts?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Because like Elon doesn't avoid them, right?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And has of car companies in the past have not avoided it?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Either.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Ford and other places have made predictions that we're going to solve level for driving by 2020 2021, whatever.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And now, they all kind of backtrack on that prediction.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I you as a as an AI person, do you find yourself privately make predictions?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Or do they get in the way of like, your actual ability to think about a thing?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I would say like, what's easy to say is that this problem is tractable.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And that's an easy prediction to make.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's trying to, it's going to work.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yes, it's just really hard.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Some things turn out to be harder than some things turn out to be easier.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So but it's it definitely feels tractable.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And it feels like, at least the team at Tesla, which is what I saw internally is definitely on track to that.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,How do you form a strong representation that allows you to make a prediction about tractability?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So like, you're the leader of a lot, a lot of humans, you have to kind of say this is actually possible?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like, how do you build up that intuition doesn't have to be even driving.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It could be other tasks, the who owns what difficult tasks that you work on your life, I mean, classification, achieving certain just an image net certain level of superhuman level performance.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, expert intuition.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Just intuition.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,That's belief.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So just like thinking about it long enough, like studying, looking at sample data, like you said, driving, my intuition was really flawed on this, like, I don't have a good intuition about tractability.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It could be either, it could be anything, it could be solvable, like, the driving task could be simplified into something quite trivial.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like, the solution to the problem would be quite trivial.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And at scale, more and more cars driving perfectly, might make the problem much easier.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And the more cars you have drive, like people learn how to drive correctly, not correctly, but in a way that's more optimal for heterogeneous system of autonomous and semi autonomous and manually driven cars, that could change stuff, then again, also, I've spent a ridiculous number of hours just staring at pedestrians crossing streets, thinking about humans, and it feels like the way we use eye contact, it sends really strong signals, and there's certain quirks and edge cases of behavior.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And of course, a lot of the fatalities that happen have to do with drunk driving, and both on the pedestrian side and the driver side.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So there's that problem of driving at night and all that kind of Yeah, so I wonder, you know, it's like the space of possible solution to autonomous driving includes so many human factor issues, that it's almost impossible to predict.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It could be super clean, nice solutions.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I would say definitely like to use a game analogy, there's some fog of war.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But you definitely also see the frontier of improvement.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And you can measure historically what you've made progress.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I think, for example, least what I've seen, and probably five years at Tesla, when I joined, it barely kept lane, on the highway.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I think going up from Palo Alto to SF was like three or four interventions, anytime the road would do anything geometrically or turn too much, it would just like not work.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so going from that to like a pretty competent system in five years, and seeing what happens is also under the hood, and what the scale at which the team is operating now with respect to data and compute, and everything else, is just a massive progress.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"you're climbing a mountain, and yes, fog, but you make a lot of progress, fog,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"you're making progress, and you see what the next directions are.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And you're looking at some of the remaining challenges and they're not like they're not perturbing you, and they're not changing your philosophy and you're not controlling, contorting yourself, you're like, actually, these are the things that we still need to do.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"The fundamental components of solving the problem seem to be there in the data engine to the computer, the computer on the car to the computer has a training, all that kind of stuff.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So you've done over the years, you've been tested, you done a lot of amazing breakthrough ideas in engineering, all of it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"From the data engine to the human side, all of it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Can you speak to why you chose to leave,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Tesla, basically, as I described that run, I think over time, during those five years, I've kind of gotten myself into a bit of a managerial position.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Most of my days were, you know, meetings and growing the organization and making decisions about sort of high level strategic decisions about it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,The team in what it should be working on and so on.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it's kind of like a corporate executive role.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I can do it, I think I'm okay at it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But it's not like fundamentally what I, what I enjoy.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so I think, when I joined, there was no computer vision team, because Tesla was just going from the transition of using Mobileye, a third party vendor for all of its computer vision to having to build its computer vision system.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So when I showed up, there were two people training deep neural networks.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And they were training them at a computer at their, at their legs, like, that's","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,a basic classification task.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so I kind of like grew that into what I think has a fairly respectable, deep learning team, a massive compute cluster, a very good data annotation organization.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I was very happy with where that was, it became quite autonomous.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so I kind of stepped away.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I, you know, I'm very excited to do much more technical things again.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And kind of like we focus on AGI,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,what was this soul searching?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Like?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,He took a little time off?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like, what?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,How many mushrooms did you take?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What what was going through your mind that human lifetime is finite?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, he did a few incredible things.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"You're, you're one of the best teachers of AI in the world, you're one of the best.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And I don't mean that I mean, in the best possible way, you one of the best tinkerers in the AI world.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Meaning like, understanding the fundamental fundamentals of how something works by building it from scratch, and playing with it with a basic intuitions.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It's like Einstein Fineman, we're all really good at this kind of stuff, like small example of a thing to, to play with it, to try to understand it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So that and obviously now with Tesla, you helped build a team of machine learning.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like engineers, and a system that actually accomplishes something in the real world.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So given all that, like, what was the soul searching like?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,What was hard?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Because obviously, I love the company a lot.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I love I love Elon, I love Tesla, I want so it's hard to leave.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I love the team, basically.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"About you, I think, actually, I will be potentially, like interested in revisiting it, maybe coming back at some point, are working on Optimus or kind of AGI at Tesla.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I think Tesla is going to do incredible things.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's basically like it's a massive, large scale robotics kind of company with a ton of in house talent for doing really incredible things.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I think humanoid robots are going to be amazing.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I think autonomous transportation is going to be amazing.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,All this happening at Tesla.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So I think it's just a really amazing organization.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So being part of it and helping it along, I think was very, it's gonna enjoy that a lot.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, it was basically difficult for those reasons, because I love the company.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But you know, I'm happy to potentially at some point, come back for act two.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But I felt like at this stage, I built the team, it felt autonomous.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I became a manager.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I wanted to do a lot more technical stuff.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"

Lex Fridman,What do you think is the best movie sequel of all times picking apart two?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Because like, because most of them suck?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What do you see what's movie sequels?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,A new tweet about movies.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"

Lex Fridman,Godfather Part Two.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Are you saying the Godfather because you didn't even tweet or mentioned the godfather?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I don't love that movie.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I know.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It hasn't been shouted that out.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,We're gonna edit out the hate towards the godfather.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,How dare you,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,make a strong statement?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I don't know why.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I don't know why, but I basically don't like any movie before.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,1995.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Something like that.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Didn't you mentioned Terminator?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Two.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Okay, okay.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,That's,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,like a terminator two was a little bit later.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"1990 No,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I think Terminator two was in a man like,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Terminator one as well.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So okay, so like few exceptions, but by and large, for some reason.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I don't like movies before 1995 or something.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,They feel very slow.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,The camera is like zoomed out.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's boring.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's kind of naive.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's kind of weird.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And also Terminator was very much ahead of its time.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And the godfather.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,There's like no AGI.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"that's, I mean, but you have Goodwill Hunting was one of the movies you mentioned.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And that doesn't have any AGI either.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I guess that's mathematics.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I guess occasionally.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I do enjoy movies that don't feature or like Anchorman that has.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"That's the thinker, man.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's so good.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I don't understand.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Um, he's speaking of AGI because I don't understand why Will Ferrell is so funny.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It doesn't make sense.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It doesn't compute.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,There's just something about him.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And he's a singular human because you don't get that many comedies these days and I wonder if it has to do about the culture or the like the the machine of Hollywood or does it have to do with just we got lucky with certain people in comedy.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It came together because he is a single human.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,That was a ridiculous tangent.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I apologize.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,But you mentioned humanoid robot.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So what do you think about Optimus about About Do you think we'll have robots in the factory in the home in 1020 3040 50 years?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I think it's very hard project, I think it's going to take a while.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But who else is going to build humanoid robots at scale.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I think it is a very good form factor to go after.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Because like I mentioned that the world is designed for humanoid form factor, these things will be able to upgrade our machines, they will be able to sit down in chairs, potentially even drive cars.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Basically, the world is designed for humans, that's the fourth factor you want to invest into and make work overtime.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I think, you know, there's another school of thought, which is, okay, pick a problem and design a robot to it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But actually designing a robot and getting a whole data engine and everything behind it to work is actually incredibly hard problem.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So it makes sense to go after General interfaces that, okay, they are not perfect for any one given task.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But they actually have the generality of just with a prompt with English able to do something across.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So I think it makes a lot of sense to go after a general interface in the physical world.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I think it's a very difficult project is going to take time.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But I see no other no other company that can execute on that vision, I think it's going to be amazing, like, basically physical labor.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Like if you think transportation is large market, try physical labor.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,But it's not just physical labor.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"To me, the thing that's also exciting is social robotics.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So the relationship will have on different levels with those robots.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,That's why I was really excited to see optimistic.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,People have criticized me for the excitement.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"But I've worked with a lot of research labs that do humanoid legged robots, Boston Dynamics unitary a lot, there's a lot of companies that do legged robots.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"But that's the the elegance of the movement is a tiny, tiny part of the big picture.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So integrating the two big exciting things to me about Tessa doing humanoid or any legged robots, is clearly integrating into the data engine.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So the data engine aspect, so the actual intelligence for the perception in the in the control and the planning and all that kind of stuff, integrating into this huge the fleet that you mentioned, right.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And then speaking of fleet, the second thing is the mass manufacture is just knowing, cultural Li, driving towards a simple robot that's cheap to produce, at scale.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And doing that, well, having experienced to do that, well, that changes everything.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"That's why that's a very different culture, and style, the Boston Dynamics, who by the way does those robots are just the way they move, it's like, it'll be a very long time before Tesla can achieve the smoothness of movement.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,But that's not what it's about.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It's about, it's about the entirety of the system, like we talked about the data engine and the fleet.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"That's super exciting, even the initial sort of models.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"But that too, was really surprising that in a few months, you can get prototype.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yep.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And the reason that happened very quickly is, as you alluded to, there's a ton of copy paste from what's happening in the autopilot, a lot.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,The amount of expertise that like came out of the woodworks at Tesla for building the human robot was incredible to see.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Like, basically Elon said, at one point, were doing this.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then next day, basically, like all these CAD models started to appear, and people talking about like the supply chain and manufacturing.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And people showed up with like screwdrivers and everything like the other day, and starts, like put together the body.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I was like, Whoa, like all these people exist at Tesla.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And fundamentally, building a car is actually not that different from building a robot, the same.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And that is true, not just for the hardware pieces.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And also, let's not forget hardware, not just for demo, but manufacturing, of that hardware at scale is a whole different thing.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But for software as well.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Basically, this robot currently thinks it's a car sort of have","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"a midlife crisis, at some, it thinks","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,it's a car.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Some of the earlier demos actually we were talking about potentially doing them outside in the parking lot, because that's where all of the computer vision that was like working out of the box, instead of like inside.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But all the operating system everything just copy pastes, computer vision, mostly copy paste, I mean, you have to retrain the neural nets, but the approach and everything and data engine and offline trackers and the way we go about the occupancy tracker, and so on everything copy paste, you just need to retrain the neural nets.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then the planning control, of course has to change quite a bit.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But there's a ton of copy paste from what's happening at Tesla.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so if you were to if you were to go with goal of like, okay, let's build a million humanoid robots, and you're not Tesla.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,That's that's a lot to ask if you're a Tesla.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's actually like, it's not, it's not that crazy.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"the follow up questions and how difficult just like we're driving, how difficult is the manipulation task, such that it can have an impact that scale?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I think, depending on the context, the really nice thing about robotics is that unless you do manufacturing, that kind of stuff Is there is more room for error driving associated critical.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And so the and also time critical, like a robot is allowed to move slower?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Which is nice.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I think it's going to take a long time.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But the way you want to structure the development is you need to say, Okay, it's going to take a long time, how can I set up the product development roadmap, so they're making revenue along the way, I'm not setting myself up for a 01 loss function where it doesn't work until it works, you don't want to be in that position, you want to make it useful almost immediately.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then you want to slowly deploy it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And at scale and safely at scale, and you want to set up your data engine, your improvement loops, the telemetry, the evaluation, the harness and everything.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And you want to improve the product over time incrementally and you're making revenue along the way, that's extremely important.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Because otherwise, you cannot build these, these large undertakings just like don't make sense economically.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And also, from the point of view of the team working on it, they need the dopamine along the way, they're not just going to make a promise about this being useful.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"This is going to change the world in 10 years, when it works.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,This is not where you want to be.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"You want to be in a place like I think our politics today where it's offering increased safety and, and convenience of driving today, people pay for it, people like it, people purchase it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then you also have the greater mission that you're working towards.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And you see that so the dopamine for the team, that that was a source of happiness,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,yes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"you're deploying this people like it, people drive it, people pay for it, they care about it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"There's all these YouTube videos, your grandma drives it, she gives you feedback, people like it, people engage with it, you engage with it huge.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Do people that drive Tesla's like recognize you and give you love?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like, like, Hey, thanks for them.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,For the nice feature that is doing?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I think the tricky thing is like, some people really love you some people unfortunately, like you're working on something that you think is extremely valuable, useful, etc.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Some people do hate you.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"There's a lot of people who like hate me and the team and whatever, the whole project.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I think Tesla drivers, many cases, they're","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"not actually yeah, that's that's actually makes me sad about humans, or the current.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,The ways that humans interact.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I think that's actually fixable.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I think humans want to be good to each other.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I think Twitter and social media is part of the mechanism that actually somehow makes the negativity more viral.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"But it doesn't deserve like disproportionately add of like a viral viral boost negativity, but I wish people would just get excited about.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So suppress some of the jealousy, some of the ego and just get excited for others.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And then there's a Karma aspect to that you get excited for others, they'll get excited for you.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Same thing in academia, if you're not careful, there's like a dynamical system there.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"If you if you think of in silos and get jealous of somebody else being successful, that actually, perhaps counter intuitively, least the less productivity of you as a community and you individually.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I feel like if you keep celebrating others, that actually makes you more successful.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And I think people haven't in, depending on the industry haven't quite learned that yet.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Some people are also very negative and very vocal.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So they're very prominently featured.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But actually, there's a ton of people who are cheerleaders, but they're silent cheerleader, cheerleaders.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And when you talk to people just in the world, they will tell you, it's amazing.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's great, especially like people who understand how difficult that is to get this stuff working, like people who have built products, makers, intrapreneur entrepreneurs, like make making this work and changing something is incredibly hard.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Those people are more likely to clearly.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Well, one of the things that makes me sad is some folks in the robotics community don't do the cheerleading, and they should.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"There's a because they know how difficult is well, they actually sometimes don't know how difficult it is to create a product that scale.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Right?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, they actually deploy in the real world.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,A lot of the development of robots and AI system is done on very specific small benchmarks as opposed to real world conditions.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I think it's really hard to work on robotics in academic setting,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"or AI systems that apply in the real world you've criticized you flourished and loved for time, the ImageNet, the famed ImageNet dataset, and have recently had some words of criticism that the academic research ml community gives a little too much love still to the image net are like, those kinds of benchmarks.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Can you speak to the strengths or weaknesses of datasets used in machine learning research?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Actually, I don't know that I recall the specific instance where I was unhappy or criticizing ImageNet I think ImageNet has been extremely valuable.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It was basically a benchmark that allowed the deep learning community to demonstrate that deep neural networks actually work.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It was a there's a massive value in that.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So I think ImageNet was useful but um, basically it's become a bit of an M nest at this point.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So M nest is like little to 28 by 28, grayscale digits.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,There's kind of a joke data set that everyone like just cry Just because no papers,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"written on them this though, right?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Maybe they should have strong papers, like papers that focus on like, how do we learn with a small amount of data?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,That stuff?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I could see that being helpful, but not in sort of like mainline computer vision research anymore.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Of course,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I think the way I've heard you somewhere, maybe I'm just imagining things.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"But I think you said like, ImageNet was a huge contribution to the community for a long time.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And now it's time to move past those kinds of,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"well, ImageNet has been crushed.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I mean, you know, the error rates are.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, we're getting like 90% accuracy, in 1000, classification way, prediction, and I've seen those images.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And it's like, really high.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"That's really, that's really good.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"If I recall correctly, the top five error rate is now like 1%, or something,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,given your experience with a gigantic real world dataset?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Would you like to see benchmarks move into certain directions that the research community uses?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Unfortunately, I don't think academics currently have the next ImageNet we've obviously I think we've crushed em NIST, we've basically kind of crushed ImageNet.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And there's no next sort of big benchmark that the entire community rallies behind and uses.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"You know, for further development of these networks.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I wonder what it takes for dataset to captivate the imagination of everybody, like where they all get behind it, that that could also need, like a viral like a leader?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Right?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Somebody with popularity?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I mean, yeah, what image that take off?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Is there?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Or is it just the accident of history?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It was,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,the right amount of difficult.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It was the right amount of difficult and simple and interesting enough, it just kind of like it was it was the right time for that kind of a dataset.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Question from Reddit?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What are your thoughts on the role that synthetic data and game engines will play in the future of neural net model development?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I think as neural nets converge to humans, the value of simulation to neural nets will be similar to value of simulation to humans.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So people use simulation for people use simulation because they can learn something in that kind of a system.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And without having to actually experience it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,But are you referring to the simulation would do in our head?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Is no,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"no sorry, simulation?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I mean, like video games or, you know, other forms of simulation for various professionals.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So let me push back on that.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Because that maybe there's simulation that we do in our heads, like, simulate if I do this, what do I think will happen?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Okay, that's like internal simulation.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, internal?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Isn't that what we're doing?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,As humans before we act?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Oh, yeah.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But that's independent from like, the use of simulation in the sense of like computer games, or using simulation for training set creation?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Or,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,is it independent?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Or is it just loosely correlated, because like, it's not useful to do like, counterfactual, or like edge case simulation to like, you know, what happens if there's a nuclear war?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"What happens if there, you know, like, those kinds of things exist?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"that's a different simulation from like, Unreal Engine.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,That's how I interpreted the question.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Ah, so","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"like, simulation of the average case?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Is that what's Unreal Engine?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What What?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What do you mean by Unreal Engine?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So simulating a world of physics to that world?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Why is that different?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like, because you also can add behavior to that world.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And you could try all kinds of stuff, right?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,You could throw all kinds of weird things into it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Unreal Engine is not just about simulate.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I mean, I guess it is about being the physics of the world.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It's also doing something with that.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, the graphics, the physics and the agents that you put into the environment and stuff like that.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"See, I think you've I feel like you said that it's not that important, I guess, for the future of AI development.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Is that Is that correct to interpret?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I think humans use simulators for humans use simulators, and they find them useful.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so computers will use simulators and find them useful.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Okay, so you just saying it's not that I don't use simulators.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Very often, I play a video game every once in a while, but I don't think I derive any wisdom about my own existence from from those video games.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It's a momentary escape from reality versus a source of wisdom about reality.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So I don't so I think that's a very polite way of saying simulation is not that useful.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, maybe maybe not.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I don't see it as like a fundamental, really important part of like training neural nets currently.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But I think, as neural nets become more and more powerful, I think you will need fewer examples to train additional behaviors.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And simulation is of course, there's a domain gap and a simulation that is not the real world is slightly something different.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But with a powerful enough neural net, you need the domain gap can be bigger, I think because neural net people sort of understand that even though it's not the real world.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It like has all this high level structure that I'm supposed to be like learn from,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"so then you don't that will actually yeah, we'll be able to leverage the synthetic data better.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yes, by close And then get back to understanding in which ways this is real data.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Exactly.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Ready to do better questions next time that was, that was a question was I'm just kidding.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,All right.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So is it possible?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Do you think speaking of feminist to construct neural nets and training processes that require very little data?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So we've been talking about huge datasets like the internet for training.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I mean, one way to say that is, like you said, like the queering itself as another level of training, I guess.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And that requires a little data.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,But do you see any value in doing research and kind of going down the direction of can we use very little data to train to construct the knowledge,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"base and 2%, I just think like, at some point, you need a massive data set.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then when you pre train your massive neural net and get something that you know, is like a GPT or something, then you're able to be very efficient at training, any arbitrary new task.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So a lot of these GPS, you can do tasks like sentiment analysis, or translation or so on, just by being prompted with very few examples.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Here's the kind of thing I want you to do.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Like, here's an input sentence, here's the translation into German input sentence translation to German input, sentence blank, and the neurological complete the translation German, just by looking at sort of the example you've provided.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So that's an example of a very few shot learning in the activations of the neural map instead of the weights of the neural net.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so I think, basically, just like humans, neural nets will become very data efficient at learning any other new tasks.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But at some point, you need a massive data set to pre train your network.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Together, probably we humans have something like that.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Do we?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Do we have something like that?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Do we have a passive in the background, background model constructing thing that just runs all the time in the self supervised way?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,We're not conscious of it?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I think humans definitely.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I mean, obviously, we have, we learned a lot during during our life span.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But also, we have a ton of hardware that helps us initialize initialization, coming from sort of evolution.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so I think that's also a really big a big component.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"A lot of people in the field, I think they just talk about the amounts of like seconds and the, you know, that person has left pretending that this is a tabula rasa, sort of like a zero initialization of the neural net.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And it's not like, you can look at a lot of animals, like for example, zebras, zebras get born, and they see and they can run, there's zero train data in their lifespan, they can just do that.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So somehow, I have no idea how evolution has found a way to encode these algorithms.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And these neural net initializations are extremely good into at CGS and have no idea how this works.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But apparently, it's possible because here's a proof by existence.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,There's something magical about going from a single cell to organism that is born to the first few years of life.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I kind of like the idea that the reason we don't remember anything about the first few years of our life, is that it's a really painful process.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Like it's a very difficult challenging training process.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, like, intellectually, like, and maybe, yeah, I mean, why don't we remember any of that, there might be some crazy training going on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And that the, maybe that's the background model of training that is, is very painful.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And so it's best for the system, once it's trained not to remember how to structure","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I think it's just like, the hardware for long term memory is just not fully developed.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I kind of feel like the first few years of, of infancy is not actually like learning.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's brain maturing.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,We're born premature.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,There's a theory along those lines because of the birth canal and the swelling of the brain.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so we're bumper mature, and then the first few years were just the brains maturing.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then there's some learning eventually.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,That's my current view on it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What do you think?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Do you think neural nets can have long term memory?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like that approach is something like humans, do you think neural do you think needs to be another meta architecture on top of it to add something like a knowledge base that learns facts about the world and all that kind of stuff?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yes, but I don't know to what extent it will be explicitly constructed.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It might take unintuitive forms where you are telling the GPT like, Hey, you have a you have a declarative memory bank to which you can store and retrieve data from.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And whenever you encounter some information that you find useful, just save it to your memory bank.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And here's an example of something you have retrieved and here's how you say it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And here's how you load from it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"You just say load, whatever, you teach it in text in English.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then it might learn to use a memory bank from from that.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Oh, so","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"it says a neural net is the architecture for the background model the the base thing and then yeah, everything else is just on top of it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So it's not just the tax, right?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's a you're giving gadgets and gizmos.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So you're teaching some kind of a special language by which it can it can save arbitrary information and retrieve it at a later time and you're You're telling me about these special tokens and how to arrange them to use these interfaces.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's like, Hey, you can use a calculator.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Here's how you use it, just do five, three plus four, one equals, and when equals is there, a calculator will actually read out the answer, and you don't have to calculator yourself.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And you just like, tell it in English, this might actually work.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Do you think in that sense, God was interesting, the Deep Mind system that it's not just the language, but actually throws it all?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"In the same pile, images, actions, all that kind of stuff.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,That's basically what we're moving towards?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I think so.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So Gato is is very much hate Kitchen Sink off approach to like, reinforcement learning lots of different environments with a single fixed transformer model, right.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I think it's a very sort of early result in that in that realm, but I think, yeah, it's along the lines of what I think things will eventually look like.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Right?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So this is the early days of a system that eventually will look like this, like from a Richard return perspective.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I'm not super huge fan of I think all these interfaces that like look very different.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I would want everything to be normalized into the same API.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So for example, screen pixels, versus API, instead of having like different world environments that have very different physics and joint configurations and appearances, and whatever, and you're having some kind of special tokens for different games that you can plug, I'd rather just normalize everything to a single interface.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So it looks the same to the neural net, if that makes sense.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So it's all going to be pixel based Pong in the end?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I think so.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Okay, let me ask you about your own personal life.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,A lot of people want to know you're one of the most productive and brilliant people in the history of AI.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What is a productive day in the life of Andre chapati look like?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What time do you wake up you imagine some kind of difference between the average productive day and a perfect productive day.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So the perfect productive day is the thing we strive towards.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And the average is kind of what it kind of converges to given all the mistakes and raw human eventualities and so on.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yep.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So what times you wake up, when you're a morning person,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I'm not a morning person, I'm a night owl, for sure.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's stable or not, it's semi stable, like a eight or nine or something like that.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"During my PhD, it was even later, I used to go to sleep usually at 3am.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I think the am hours are, are precious, a very interesting time to work because everyone is asleep.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"At 8am, or 7am, the East Coast is awake.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So there's already activity, there's already some text messages, wherever there's stuff happening, you can go on like some news website, and there's stuff happening distracting.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"At 3am, everything is totally quiet.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so you're not going to be bothered, and you have solid chunks of time to do your work.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So I like those periods, Night Owl by default.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then I think like productive time, basically, what I like to do is you need a you need to like build some momentum on the problem without too much distraction.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And you need to load your REM, your working memory with that problem.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then you need to be obsessed with it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"When you're taking shower, when you're falling asleep.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"You need to be obsessed with the problem and it's fully in your memory, and you're ready to wake up and work on it right there.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So that is the skill is this in a scale temporal skill of a single day or a couple of days a week, a month.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So I can't talk about one day basically in isolation, because it's a whole process, when I want to get when I want to get productive in the problem, I feel like I need a span of a few days where I can really get in on that problem.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I don't want to be interrupted.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I'm going to just be completely obsessed with that problem.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And that's where I do most of my good workouts.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"You've done a bunch of cool, like little projects in a very short amount of time very quickly.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So that requires you just focusing on it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, basically, I need to load my working memory with the problem.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I need to be productive because there's always like a huge fixed cost to approaching the problem.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"You know, like I was struggling with this, for example, at Tesla because I want to work on like small side project.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But okay, you first need to figure out okay, I need to SSH into my cluster, I need to bring up a VS code editor.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So I can like work on this, I need to I run into some stupid error because of some reason, like you're not at a point where you can be just productive right away, you are facing barriers.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so it's about really removing all of that barrier and you're able to go into the problem and you have the full problem loaded in your memory,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"and somehow avoiding distractions of all different forms like news stories, emails, but also distractions from other interesting projects that you previously worked on are currently working on so on you just want to really focus your mind","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,and I mean I can take some time off for distractions and in between but I think it can be too much.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,You know most of your day is sort of like spent on that problem.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then you know, I drink coffee or you have my morning routine I look at some news, Twitter Hacker News, Wall Street Journal, etc.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So he's great so basically you,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"wake up Have some coffee, are you trying to get to work as quickly as possible do you do taking this diet of of like what the hell's happening in the world first?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I am I do find it interesting to know about the world.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I don't Know that it's useful or good, but it's part of my routine right now.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So I do read through a bunch of news articles, and I want to be informed.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I'm suspicious of it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I'm suspicious of the practice.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But currently, that's where I am.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Oh, you mean","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"suspicious about the positive effect of that practice on your productivity and your well being and well being psychologically, and also on your ability to deeply understand the world?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Because how there's a bunch of source of information, you're not really focused on deeply integrating that's a little bit distracting, you're in terms of perfectly productive day, for what how long of a stretch of time, in one session, do try to work and focus on the thing.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,A couple hours is a one hour is it?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"30 minutes, 10 minutes,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I can probably go like a small few hours.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then I need some breaks in between, for like food and stuff.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And yeah, but I think like, it's still really hard to accumulate hours, I was using a tracker that told me exactly how much time I spent coding any one day.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And even on a very productive day, I still spent only like six or eight hours.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And it's just because there's so much padding, commute, talking to people, food, etc.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"There's like a cost of life, just living and sustaining and homeostasis.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And just maintaining yourself as a human is very high.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And that there seems to be a desire within the human mind to to, to participate in society that creates that pattern.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Because I, the most productive days have ever had is just completely from start to finish his tuning out everything, and just isn't there.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And then you could do more than six and eight hours.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Is there some wisdom about what gives you strength to do like, tough days of long focus?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, just like, whenever I get obsessed about a problem, something just needs to work.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Something just needs to exist, it needs","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,to exist in unit.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And so you're able to deal with bugs and programming issues and technical issues and design decisions that turn out to be the wrong ones, you're able to think through all that given given that you want to think to exist,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"yeah, nice to exist.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then I think, to me, also, a big factor is, you know, our other humans are going to appreciate it, or they're going to like it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And that's a big part of my motivation.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"If I'm helping humans, and they seem happy.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,They say nice things.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"They tweet about it or whatever, that gives me pleasure, because I'm doing something useful.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So like, you do see yourself sharing it with the world like Well, yes, on GitHub was a blog post or two videos.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I was thinking about it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Like, suppose I did all these things, but did not share them.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I don't think I would have the same amount of motivation that I can build up.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,You enjoy the feeling of other people gaining value and happiness from the stuff that you've created.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"What about diet is there I saw you played with intermittent fasting, you fast ZZ that help with everything, with the things you played was been most beneficial to the your ability to mentally focus on the thing, and just meant the mantra productivity and happiness is still fast.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, so","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,fast.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But I do intermittent fasting.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But really what it means at the end of the day is I skipped breakfast.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And yeah, so I do 18 Six, roughly, by default, when I'm in my steady state, if I'm traveling or doing something else, I will break the rules.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But in my steady state, I do 18 Six.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So I eat only from 12 to six.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Not a hard rule, and I break it often.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But that's my default.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then, yeah, I've done a bunch of random experiments.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"For the most part right now, where I've been for the last year and a half I want to say is plant based or plant forward?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I heard plant forward, it sounds that I mean, exactly.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I didn't actually know the differences, but it sounds better in my mind.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But it just means I prefer plant based food, and raw or cooked or I prefer cooked and plant based.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So plant based.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Forgive me, I don't actually know how wide the category of plan entails.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Well, it just means that you're not like lectured about is you can flex and you just prefer to eat plants.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And you know, you're not making you're not trying to influence other people.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And if someone is you come to someone's house party and they serve you a steak that they're really proud of you will eat it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Oh, that's beautiful.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I mean, that's the flip side of that, but I'm very sort of flexible.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Have you tried doing one meal a day?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I have.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Accidentally, not consistently, but I've accidentally had that.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I don't I don't like it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I think it makes me feel not good.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's too it's too much too much of a hit.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so currently, I have about two meals a day.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,12 and six.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I do that nonstop.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I'm doing you know, do one meal a day because it's interesting.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It's interesting field.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Have you ever fasted longer than a day?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I've done a bunch of water fasts because I was curious what happens when anything interesting?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I would say so.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I mean, you know, what's interesting is that you're hungry for two days, and then starting day three or so you're not hungry.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,You It's like such a weird feeling because you haven't eaten in a few days and you're not hungry.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Isn't that weird?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It's really one of the many weird things about human biology is figure something out and finds finds another source of energy or something like that.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Or relaxes the system.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I don't know how Yeah,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"the body is like you're hungry, you're hungry, and then it just gives up it's like okay, I guess we're fasting now.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"There's nothing And then it just kind of like focuses on trying to make you not hungry, and not feel the damage of that and trying to give you some space to figure out the food situation.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So I, you still to this day, most productive at night,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I would say I am, but it is really hard to maintain my PhD schedule.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Especially when I was say, working at Tesla, and so on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's a non starter.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So But even now, like, you know, people want to meet for various events, they society lives in a certain period of time.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And you sort of have to like, work with that.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It's hard to like, do a social thing.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And then after that return and do work,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"yeah, it's just really hard.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,That's why I try to do social thing.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I try not to do too, too much drinking so I can return and continue doing work.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"But a Tesla is there is there conversions, then Tesla, but any, any company?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Is there a convergence tones the schedule?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Or is there more?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Is that how humans behave?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,When they collaborate?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I need to learn about this, do they try to keep us consistent schedule, you're all awake at the same time,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I'm going to do try to create a routine.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I tried to create a steady state in which I'm comfortable.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so I have a morning routine, I have a daily routine, I tried to keep things through steady state, and things are predictable.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then you can sort of just like your body just sort of like sticks to that.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And if you tried to stress that a little too much, it will create a you know, when you're traveling and you're dealing with jetlag, you're not able to really ascend to, you know where you need to go.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, yeah, that's humans with the habits and stuff.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What are your thoughts on work life balance throughout a human lifetime?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So that same part was known for pushing people to their limits, in terms of what they're able to do in terms of what they're trying to do in terms of how much they work, all that kind of stuff?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I mean, I will say test like, it's all too much bad rep for this, because what's happening is Tesla is a it's a bursty environment.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So I would say the baseline, my only point of reference is Google, or like, where I've interned three times, and I saw what it's like inside Google and DeepMind.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I would say the baseline is higher than that.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But then there's a punctuated equilibrium, where once in a while, there's a fire.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And some, like, people work really hard.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so it's spiky, and bursty.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then all the stories get collected upon the bursts.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then it gives the appearance of like, total insanity, but actually, it's just a bit more intense environment.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And there are fires and sprints.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so I think, you know, it definitely though I, I would say it's a more intense environment than something you would get,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"

Lex Fridman,Or is it such a thing?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Not a good thought experiment?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, I think","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I think balance is good.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But I also love to have Sprint's that are out of distribution.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And that's when I think I've been pretty creative.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And as well,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"

Andrej Karpathy,"You're SSH into a cluster, and you're working remotely.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"But what about the actual development like using the ID,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,you would use?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I think a good way is you just run VS code.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"My favorite editor right now on your Mac, but you are actually you have a remote folder through SSH.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So the actual files that you're manipulating are on the cluster somewhere else.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So what's the best IDE VS code?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What else do people use?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So I use Emacs?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Still?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Let's go.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It may be cool.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I don't know if it's maximum product.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,tivity so what do you recommend in terms of editors?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"You worked a lot of software engineers, editors for Python, C++, machine learning applications.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I think the current answer is VS code.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Currently, I believe that's the best IDE.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's got a huge amount of extensions.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It has GitHub copilot integration, which I think is very valuable.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What do you think about the copilot integration?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I was actually I got to talk a bunch with Guido van Rossum was the creator of Python.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And he loves cocoa, you like programs a lot with it?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Do you?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, he's copilot.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I love it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And it's free for me, but I would pay for it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I think it's very good.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And the utility that I found with it was isn't isn't, I would say there's a learning curve.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And you need to figure out when it's helpful and when to pay attention to its outputs.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And when it's not going to be helpful, where you should not pay attention to it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Because if you're just reading it suggestions all the time, it's not a good way of interacting with it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But I think I was able to sort of like mold myself to it, I find it very helpful number one in copy, paste and replace some parts.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So when the pattern is clear, it's really good at completing the pattern.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And number two, sometimes it suggests API's that I'm not aware of.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So it tells you about something that you didn't know.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So and that's an opportunity to discover and use an opportunity to see I would never take a pilot code as given I almost always copy a copy paste into a Google search, and you see what this function is doing?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then you're like, oh, it's actually actually exactly what I need.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Thank you copilot.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So you learn something.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,it's in part a search engine apart?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Maybe getting the exact syntax correctly that once you see it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, it's that NP hard things.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Once you see it, you know, yes, exact correct.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Exactly what you yourself can vary.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"You can verify efficiently, but you can't generate efficiently","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"and copilot really, I mean, it's it's autopilot for programming, right?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And currently is doing the link following which is like the simple copy, paste and sometimes suggest, but over time, it's going to become more and more autonomous.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so the same thing will play out in not just coding, but actually across many, many different things.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Probably,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"coding is an important one, right?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,writing programs.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"What how do you see the future that developing the program synthesis, like being able to write programs that are more and more complicated?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Because right now, it's human supervised?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,in interesting ways?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like, what it feels like the transition will be very painful.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"My mental model for it is the same thing will happen to us with the autopilot, also currently is doing the following is doing some simple stuff.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And eventually, we'll be doing autonomy and people will have to intervene less and less.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And those could be like you like testing mechanisms.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like if a writes a function, and that function looks pretty damn correct.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,But how do you know it's correct?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Because you're like getting lazier and lazier as a programmer, like your ability to know because like little bugs, but it gets it won't make a little noise.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Well, it copilot will make our off by one subtle bugs.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It has done that to me.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But do you,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,think future systems will?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Or is it really the off by one is actually a fundamental challenge of programming.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"In that case, it wasn't fundamental, and I think things can improve.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But I think humans have to supervise.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I am nervous about people not supervising what comes out.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And what happens to for example, the proliferation of bugs in all of our systems.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I'm nervous about that.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But I think there will probably be some other copilots for bug finding and stuff like that at some point.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So there'll be like a lot more automation for,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,man.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It's like a program, a copilot that generates a compiler.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"One that does a linter Yes, one that does like a type checker.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's a committee you have like a GPT serve, like, and then","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,there'll be like a manager for the committee.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And then there'll be somebody that says a new version of this as needed, we need to regenerate it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, there were 10 deputies that were forwarded and get 50 suggestions.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And other one looked at it and pick the few that they like a bug one looked at it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it was like it's probably a bug that got re ranked by some other thing.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then a final ensemble GPT comes in, it's like okay, given everything you guys have told me, this is probably the next token.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"You know, the feeling is the number of programmers in the world has been growing and growing very quickly.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Do you think it's possible that it will actually level out and drop to like a very low number will this kind of world because then you'll be doing software 2.0 programming.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And you'll be doing this kind of generation of copilot type systems programming, but you won't be doing the old school, Song software 1.0 program.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I don't currently think that they're just going to replace human programmers.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I'm so hesitant saying stuff like this, right?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Because,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,this is going to be replaced in five years.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I don't know it's going to show that like this is where we thought that because I agree with you, but I think we might be very surprised.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Right?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like, what what are the next i What's your sense of where we stand on language models like does it feel like the beginning or the middle or the end the beginning?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,100% I think the big part In my mind is for sure GPT will be able to program quite well competently and so on.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"How do you steer the system, you still have to provide some guidance to what you actually are looking for.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so how do you steer it?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And how do you say how do you talk to it?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,How do you audit it and verify that what is done is correct.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And how do you like work with this?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And it's as much not just an AI problem, but a UI UX problem?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So beautiful, fertile ground for so much interesting work for vs. Code plus, plus where you're not just it's not just human programming anymore.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's amazing.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So you're interacting with the system.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So not just one prompt.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"But it's iterative prompting, Yeah, we tried to figure out having a conversation with the system.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"That I mean, to me, that's super exciting to have a conversation with the program I'm running.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, maybe at some point you're just conversing with, it's like, Okay, here's what I want to do.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Actually, this variable.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Maybe it's not even that low level is variable.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"you can also imagine, like, can you translate this to C++ and back to Python?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Already?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Kind of existence?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"No, but just like doing it as part of the programming experience?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like, I think I'd like to write this function in C++.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Or like, you just keep changing for different different programs, because the different syntax syntax, maybe I want to convert this into a functional language.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So like, you get to become multilingual, as a programmer, and dance back and forth efficiently.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I mean, I think the UI UX fit though, is like still very hard to think through.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Because it's not just about writing code on a page, you have an entire developer environment, you have a bunch of hardware on it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"You have some environmental variables, you have some scripts that are running in a cron job, like there's a lot going on to like working with computers, and how do these systems, set up environment flags and work across multiple machines and set up screen sessions and automate different processes like how that works, and is auditable by humans and so on is like, massive question on my mind.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,You've built,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"archive sanity, what is archive, and what is the future of academic research publishing that you would like to see.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So archive is this preprint server.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So if you have a paper, you can submit it for publication to journals or conferences, and then wait six months, and then maybe get a decision pass or fail, or you can just upload it to archive.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then people can tweet about it three minutes later, and then everyone sees it, everyone reads it, and everyone can profit from it in their own ways, and you can cite","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And it has an official look to it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It feels like a pub.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Like it feels like a publication process.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, it feels different than if you just put it in a blog post.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Oh, yeah.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I mean, it's a paper.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And usually the bar is higher for something that you would expect on archive, as opposed to something you would see in a blog post,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"or the culture created the bar, because you could probably guess, host a pretty crappy fix for an archive.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So what was that make you feel like?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What was that make you feel about peer review?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So rigorous peer review by two, three experts versus the peer review of the community?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Right, as it's written?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"basically, I think the community is very well able to peer review things very quickly on Twitter.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I think maybe it just has to do something with AI machine learning field specifically, though, I feel like things are more easily auditable.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And the verification is easier, potentially, than the verification somewhere else.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So it's kind of like, you can think of these scientific publications, there's like little blockchains, where everyone's building on each other's work and setting each other.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And you sort of have AI, which is kind of like this much faster and loose blockchain.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But then you have any one individual entry is like, very, very cheap to make.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then you have other fields where maybe that model doesn't make as much sense.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so I think in AI, at least things are pretty easily verifiable.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so that's why when people upload papers are a really good idea on so on, people can try it out the next day.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And they can be the final arbiter of whether it works or not on their problem.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And the whole thing just moves significantly faster.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So I kind of feel like academia still has a place sort of dislike conference, journal process still has a place.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But it's sort of like an it lags behind, I think, and it's a bit more maybe higher quality process.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But it's not sort of the place where you will discover cutting edge work anymore.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, it used to be the case when I was starting my PhD, that you go to conferences and journals, and you discuss all the latest research.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Now when you go to a conference or journal like no one discusses anything that's there, because it's already like three generations ago.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Irrelevant.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yes, it was.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It makes me sad about like DeepMind, for example, where they still they still publish in nature.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And these big, prestigious, I mean, there's still value I suppose, to the prestige that comes with these venues.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,But the result is that they they will announce some breakthrough performance.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And it will take like a year to actually publish the details.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I mean, and those details, if they will publish immediately will inspire the community to move in certain directions with it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, let's","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,speed up the rest of the community.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But I don't know to what extent that's part of their objective function also.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Sure.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It's not just the prestige a little bit of the delay is is part,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"yeah, they certainly DeepMind specifically has been Working in the regime of having slightly higher quality, basically process and latency and publishing those papers that way.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Another question from Reddit, do you or have you suffered from impostor syndrome being the director of AI Tesla, being this person, when you're at Stanford where like the world looks at you, as the expert in AI to teach, teach the world about machine learning.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"When I was leaving Tesla, after five years, I spent a ton of time in meeting rooms.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"

Andrej Karpathy,"And so this is just natural progression that happens, I think, and definitely, I would say, near the tail end, that's when it sort of starts to hit you a bit more that you're supposed to be an expert.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But actually, the source of truth is the code that people are writing the GitHub and the actual, the actual code itself.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And you're not as familiar with that as he used to be.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so I would say, maybe there's some like insecurity there.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And that's actually pretty profound, that a lot of the insecurity has to do with not writing the code in the computer science base like that, because that is the truth that there is a code is","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"the source of truth, the papers and everything else, it's a high level summary, I don't know, just a high level summary.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But at the end of the day, you have to read code, it's impossible to translate all that code into actual, you know, paper form.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So when when things come up, especially when they have a source code available, that's my favorite place to go.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So like I said, you're one of the greatest teachers of machine learning AI ever, from ces 231.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,End to today.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"What advice would you give to beginners interested in getting into machine learning,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"beginners are often focused on like, what to do.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I think the focus should be more like how much you do.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So I'm kind of like believer on the high level, and this 10,000 hours kind of concept, where you just kind of have to just pick the things where he can spend time and you care about and you're interested in, you literally have to put in 10,000 hours of work.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It doesn't even like matter as much like where you put it, and you're, you'll iterate and you'll improve, and you'll waste some time, I don't know if there's a better way, you need to put in 10,000 hours.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But I think it's actually really nice, because I feel like there's some sense of determinism about being an expert at a thing, if you spend 10,000 hours, you can literally pick an arbitrary thing.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I think if you spend 10,000 hours of deliberate effort and work, you actually will become an expert at it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so I think it's kind of like a nice thought.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so basically, I would focus more on like, are you spending 10,000 hours and focus on","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"so and then thinking about what kind of mechanisms maximize your likelihood of getting to 10,000 hours exactly, which, for us, silly humans means probably forming a daily habit of like, every single day actually doing the thing,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,whatever helps you.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So I just think to a large extent, is a psychological problem for yourself.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"One other thing that I hope that I think is helpful for the psychology of it is many times people compare themselves to others in the area, I think it's very harmful.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Only compare yourself to you from some time ago.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Like, say, a year ago, are you better than you year ago, is the only way to think.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I think this then you can see your progress.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it's very motivating.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it's,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"so interesting, that focus on the quantity of hours, because I think a lot of people in the beginner stage but actually throughout get paralyzed by the choice like which one?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Do I pick this path or this path?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like, they'll literally get paralyzed by like, which ID to use?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Well, they're worried, yeah, they'll worried about all these things.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But the thing is, some of you will waste time doing something wrong.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yes, you will eventually figure out it's not right, you will accumulate scar tissue.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And next time, you'll grow stronger, because next time, you'll have the scar tissue.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And next time, you'll learn from it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And now next time you come to a similar situation, you'll be like, Oh, I, I messed up.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I've spent a lot of time working on things that never materialized into anything.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I have all that scar tissue.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I have some intuitions about what was useful, what wasn't useful, how things turned out.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So all those mistakes where we're not dead work, you know, so I just think you shouldn't be here.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Just focus on working.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,What have you done?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,What have you done last week?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"That's a good question, actually, to ask for a lot of things that just machine learning.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It's a good way to cut the, the way I forgot what the term we use, but the fluff the blob, or whatever the the inefficiencies in life.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What do you love about teaching?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"You seem to find yourself often in the, like, drawn to teaching, you're very good at it, but you're also drawn to it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I mean, I don't think I love teaching.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I love happy humans.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And how humans live when I teach.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I wouldn't say I hate teaching.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I tolerate teaching, but it's not like the act of teaching that I like it's, it's that, you know, I have some I have something I'm actually okay at it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yes, I'm okay at teaching and people appreciate it a lot.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so I'm just happy to try to be helpful.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And teaching itself is not like the most.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I mean, it's really, it's can be really annoying, frustrating.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I was working on a bunch of lectures just now.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I was reminded back to my days of 31 and just how much work it is to create some of these materials to make them good.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,The amount of iteration and thought and you go down blind alleys and just how much you change it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So creating something good in terms of like educational value is really hard.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it's not fun,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,was difficult.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So people should definitely go watch in new stuff you put their lectures, we actually building the thing like from, like you said the code is truth.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So discussing backpropagation by building it by looking through it and just the whole thing.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So how difficult is that to prepare for?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,That's a really powerful way to teach.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,How did you have to prepare for that?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Are you just live thinking through it,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I will typically do like, say three takes, and then I take like, the better take.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So I do multiple takes, and I take some of the better takes and then I just build out a lecture that way.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Sometimes I have to delete 30 minutes of content, because it just went down an alley that I've been like too much.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,There's a bunch of iteration.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And it probably takes me, you know, somewhere around 10 hours to create one hour of content","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,to give one hour.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It's interesting.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I mean, is it difficult to go back to the basics?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Do you draw a lot of like wisdom from going back to the basics?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"going back to back propagation loss functions, where they come from.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And one thing I like about teaching a lot, honestly, is it definitely strengthens your understanding.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So it's not a purely altruistic activity, it's a way to learn.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"If you have to explain something to someone, you realize you have gaps in knowledge.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so I even surprised myself in those lectures, like, oh, the results will obviously look at this, and then the result doesn't look like it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I'm like, Okay, I thought I understood this.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"That's why it's really cool to literally code, you run it in a notebook, and it gives you a result, and you're like, oh, wow, yes, like actual numbers, actual input, actual code that's not","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"mathematical symbols, etc.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,The source of truth is the code.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's not slides.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's just like, Let's build it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It's beautiful.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,You're rare human in that sense?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What advice would you give to researchers trying to develop and publish idea that have a big impact in the world of AI?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So maybe undergrads, maybe early graduate students?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yep.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I mean, I would say like, they definitely have to be a little bit more strategic than I had to be as a PhD student, because of the way AI is evolving.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's going the way of physics where, you know, in physics, he used to be able to do experiments on your benchtop.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And everything was great.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And you can make progress.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And now you have to work in like LHC, or like CERN, and, and so AI is going in that direction as well.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So there's certain kinds of things it's just not possible to do on the benchtop anymore.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I think that didn't used to be the case.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"At the time,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"do you still think that there's like, gan type papers to be written, where like, like, very simple idea that requires just one computer to illustrate a simple example.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I mean,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,one example that's been very influential recently is diffusion models.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,The future models are amazing.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Diffusion models are six years old.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"For the longest time, people are kind of ignoring them, as far as I can tell.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And they're an amazing generative model, especially in images.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so stable diffusion and so on.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's all diffusion based, diffusion is new, it was not there and came from, well, it came from Google, but a researcher could have come up with it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"In fact, some of the first actually know those came from Google as well.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But a researcher could come up with that in an academic institution.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What do you find most fascinating about diffusion models?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So from the societal impact of the technical,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"architecture, what I like about the fusion is it works so well.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It was surprising to the amount of the variety, almost the novelty of the synthetic data is generating,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,yes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So the stable diffusion images are incredible.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's the speed of improvement in generating images has been insane.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"We went very quickly from generating like, tiny digits to little tiny faces, and it all looked messed up.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And now we were stable diffusion.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And that happened very quickly.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"There's a lot that academia can still contribute, you know, for example, on flash attention is a very efficient kernel for running the attention operation inside the transformer that came from an academic environment.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's a very clever way to structure the kernel that does the calculation.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So it doesn't materialize the attention matrix.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so there's I think there's still like lots of things to contribute, but you have to be just more strategic.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Do you think neural networks can be made to reason?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Oh, yes.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Do you think there already reason?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What's your definition of reasoning?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Information processing.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So the way that humans think through a problem and come up with novel ideas.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It feels like reasoning.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So the novelty that I don't want to say but out of distribution ideas, you think is","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,possible?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I think we're seeing that already in the current neural nets.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"You're able to remix the training set information into true generalization in some sense, that doesn't appear it doesn't insert them into a training set.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Like you're doing something interesting algorithmically.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"you're manipulating, you know, some symbols and you're coming up with I'm correct a unique answer in a new setting,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"what would illustrate to you Holy shit, this thing is definitely thinking.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,To me thinking or reasoning is just information processing and generalization.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I think the neural nets already do that today.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So being able to perceive the world or perceive the whatever the inputs are, and to make predictions based on that, or actions based on that that's that's reason, yeah, you're","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,giving correct answers in novel settings.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"By manipulating information, you've learned to correct algorithm.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,You're not doing just some kind of a lookup table and nearest neighbor search.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Let me ask you about AGI.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What are some moonshot ideas you think might make significant progress towards AGI?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And maybe another way is, what are the big blockers that we're missing now?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So basically, I'm fairly bullish on our ability to build AGI is basically automated systems that we can interact with, and are very human like, and we can interact with them in the digital realm or physical realm.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Currently, it seems most of the models that sort of do these sort of magical tasks are in a text realm.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I think, as I mentioned, I'm suspicious that text realm is not enough to actually build full understanding of the world, I do actually think you need to go into pixels and understand the physical world and how it works.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So I do think that we need to extend these models to consume images and videos and train on a lot more data that is multimodal in that way.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Do you think you need to touch the world to understand also?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Well, that's the big open question I would say in my mind is if you also require the embodiment and the ability to sort of sort of interact with the world run experiments and have a data of that form, then you need to go to optimists, or something like that.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so I would say optimist in some way as like a hedge in AGI because it seems to me that it's possible that just having data from the internet is not enough.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"If that is the case, then optimists may lead to AGI because optimists were I, to me, there's nothing beyond Optimus, you have like this humanoid form factor that can actually like do stuff in the world, you can have millions of them interacting with humans and so on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And if that doesn't give rise to AGI at some point, like, I'm not sure what will.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So from a completeness perspective, I think that's the, that's a really good platform.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But it's a much harder platform, because you are dealing with atoms, and you need to actually like build these things and integrate them into society.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So I think that path takes longer, but it's much more certain.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then there's a path of the internet and just like training these compression models effectively, on trying to compress all the internet.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And that might also give these agents as well,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"compress the internet, but also interact with the Internet.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So it's not obvious to me.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"In fact, I suspect you can reach AGI without ever entering the physical world.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And then, which is a little bit more concerning because it might that results in it happening faster.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So it just feels like we're in again, boiling water, we won't know as it's happening.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I would like to, I'm not afraid of AGI.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I'm excited about it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"There's always concerns, but I would like to know when it happens.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Oh, and have like hints about when it happens, like a year from now.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It will happen that kind of thing.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, I just feel like in the digital realm, it just might happen.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I think all we have available to us because no one has built AGI again.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So all we have available to us is Is there enough fertile ground on the periphery?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I would say yes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And we have the progress so far, which has been very rapid.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And there are next steps that are available.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so I would say yeah, it's quite likely that we'll be interacting with digital","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,entities.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,How will you know that somebody has built a Jeep it's,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,going to be a slow I think it's going to be a slow incremental transition is going to be product based and focus is going to be GitHub copilot getting better.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then GPT is helping you right and then these Oracle's that you can go to with mathematical problems.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I think we're on the on the verge of being able to ask very complex questions in chemistry, physics, math of these Oracle's and have them complete solutions.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So AGI to us primarily focus on intelligence, so consciousness doesn't enter into into it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So in my mind, consciousness is not a special thank you will, you will figure out and bolt on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I think it's an emergent phenomenon of a large enough and complex enough generative model, sort of.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So if you have a complex enough world model that understands the world, then it also understands its predicament in the world as being a language model, which to me is a form of consciousness or self awareness.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"so in order to understand the world deeper, you probably have to integrate yourself into the world and in order to interact with humans and other living beings.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Consciousness is a very useful,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,tool.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I think consciousness is like a modeling insight.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Modeling insight.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, it's a, you have a powerful enough model of understanding the world that you actually understand that you are an entity in it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"there's also this, perhaps just the narrative, we tell ourselves, there's a, it feels like something to experience the world, the hard problem of consciousness.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,But that could be just the narrative that we tell ourselves.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, I don't","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"think I think it will emerge, I think it's going to be something very boring.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Like, we'll be talking to these digital AIS, they will claim their conscious, they will appear conscious, they will do all the things that you would expect of other humans.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it's going to just be a stalemate.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I think there'll be a lot of actual, fascinating ethical questions, like Supreme Court level questions of whether you're allowed to turn off a conscious AI, if you're allowed to build a conscious AI, maybe there would have to be the same kind of debates that you have around.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Sorry, to bring up a political topic.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"But you know, abortion, which is a deeper question with abortion, is what is life?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And the deep question with AI is also what is life and what is conscious, and I think that'll be very fascinating.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"To bring up, it might become illegal to build systems that are capable, that like, have such level of intelligence, that consciousness would emerge, and therefore the capacity to suffer will emerge?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And some system that says, no, please don't kill me.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Well, that's what the lambda compute the lambda chatbot already told, this Google engineer, right, like it was talking about not wanting to die, or so on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So that,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"might become illegal to do that, right.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Because otherwise, you might have a lot of a lot of creatures that don't want to die, and they will","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,respond to someone cluster.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And then that might lead to like horrible consequence, because then there might be a lot of people that secretly love murder, and they'll start practicing murder.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And those systems mean, there's just, to me, all of this stuff just brings a beautiful mirror to the human condition.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And human nature will get to explore it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And that's what like the best of the Supreme Court of all the different debates we have about ideas of what it means to be human, we get to ask those deep questions that we'll be asking, throughout human history, there has always been the other in human history, where the good guys and that's the bad guys, and we'll go on to, you know, throughout human history, let's murder the bad guys.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And the same will probably happen with robots, it'll be the other at first, and then we'll get to ask questions, and what does it mean to be alive?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What does it mean to be conscious?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I think there's some canaries in the coal mines, even with what we have today.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Um, and, you know, like, for example, these there's these like, why foods that you like to work with, and some people are trying to, like, this company is going to shut down but this person really like?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, love their why foo and, like, strange, like ported somewhere else?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And like, it's not possible.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And like, I think, like, definitely, people will have feelings towards towards these systems, because in some sense, they are like a mirror of humanity.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Because they are like, sort of like a big average of humanity in the way that it's trained","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"it but we can, that average, we can actually watch.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And it's nice to be able to interact with the big average of humanity.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And do like a search query on it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, that's very fascinating.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And we can also, of course, also like, shape it, it's not just a pure average, we can mess with the training data, we can mess with the objective, we can fine tune them in various ways.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So we have some impact on what those systems look like,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,if you want to achieve AGI.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And you could have a conversation with her and ask her talk about anything, maybe ask her a question what what kind of stuff would you would you ask?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I would have some practical questions in my mind, like, do I or my loved ones really have to die?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,What can we do about that?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Do you think it will answer clearly?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Or would it answer poetically,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I would expect it to give solutions, I would expect to be like, Well, I've read all of these textbooks, and I know all these things that you've produced.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it seems to me like here are the experiments that I think it would be useful to run next.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And here's some gene therapies that I think would be helpful.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And here are the kinds of experiments that you should run.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Okay,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,let's go with this thought experiment.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Okay.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Imagine that.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Mortality is actually like our prerequisite for happiness.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So if we become a mortal, we'll actually become deeply unhappy.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And the model is able to know that.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So what is it supposed to tell you stupid human about it?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yes, you can become a mortal, but you will become deeply unhappy.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,If the model is if the AGI system is trying to empathize with you human What is it supposed to tell you?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"That yes, you don't have to die but you're really not going to like it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Because you're going to be deeply honest.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like there As a Interstellar, what is it?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"The AI says like, humans want 90% Honesty.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So like you have to pick how Honesdale want to answer these practical questions.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I love AI.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Interstellar, by the way, I think it's like such a sidekick to the entire story.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But at the same time, it's like really interesting.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It's kind of limited in certain ways, right?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"

Andrej Karpathy,limited.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I think that's totally fine.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"By the way, I don't think I think it's fine implausible to have a limited and imperfect AGI is,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,is that the feature almost,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"as an example, like it has a fixed amount of compute on its physical body.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And it might just be that even though you can have a super amazing mega brain, super intelligent AI equals can have like, you know, less intelligent AI so you can deploy in a power efficient way.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then they're not perfect.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,They might make mistakes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"No, I","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"meant more like, say you had infinite compute.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And it's still good to make mistakes sometimes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like in order to integrate yourself like, what is it going back to Goodwill Hunting, Robin Williams character says, like the human imperfections, that's the good stuff, right?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Isn't it?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Isn't that the, like, we don't want perfect, we want flaws, in part, to form connections with each other.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Because it feels like something you can attach your feelings to the flaws in that same way you want an AI that's flawed.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I don't know.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I feel like perfectionist, but then you're saying okay, yeah.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Well, that's not AGI But see, AGI would need to be intelligent enough to give answers to humans that humans don't understand.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And I think perfect is something humans can understand.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"

Lex Fridman,That's another question.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Would it be able to, presumably in order to if it understands humans deeply would able to generate?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,To generate humor?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I think that's actually a wonderful benchmark, almost like is it able?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I think that's a really good point, basically, to make you laugh.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,If it's able to be like a very effective stand up comedian that is doing something very interesting computationally.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I think being funny is extremely hard.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Because it's hard in a way, like a Turing test.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,The original intent of the Turing test is hard.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Because you have to convince humans, and there's nothing as what?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"That's what when comedians talk about this, like, there's this is deeply honest.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"

Andrej Karpathy,"you need a lot of knowledge to create to create humor, about the automation, human condition, and so on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"

Andrej Karpathy,And,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"there's also dance between the genius and the personal, like, what it means to love another human being.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And there's a lot of things there is just a beautiful movie, and then the fatherly figure, the mentor in the psychiatrist and it like, really,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"like, it messes with you, you know, there's some movies that just like really mess with you.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"on a deep level,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,do you relate to that movie at all?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"No, it's like I said, Lord of the Rings, it's self explanatory.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Terminator two, which is interesting.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,You rewatch that?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Oh, there's that better than Terminator one?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"You like, you're like Terminator","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,one as well.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I like Terminator two a little bit more.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But in terms of like its surface properties.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I do you think Skynet is at all a possibility?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Like the actual sort of autonomous weapon system kind of thing?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Do you worry about that stuff?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I do worry, I use a war.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I 100% worry about it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so the I mean, the, you know, some of these fears of AGI and how this will pan out.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I mean, these will be like very powerful entities, probably at some point.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so for a long time, they're going to be tools in the hands of humans.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"You know, people talk about like, alignment of AGI and how to make the problem is like even humans are not aligned.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So how this will be used?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And what this is going to look like it's yes, troubling.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So do you,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"think it'll happen slowly, slowly enough that we'll be able to, as a human civilization, think through the problems?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yes,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"that's my hope is that it's happened slowly enough, and an open enough way where a lot of people can see and participate in it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Just figure out how to deal with this transition?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I think it was kind of interesting,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I draw a lot of inspiration from nuclear weapons, because I sure thought it would be would be fucked once would they develop nuclear weapons.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"But like, it's almost like, when, when the systems are not so dangerous, they destroy human civilization, we deploy them and learn the lessons.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And then we quickly if it's too dangerous, we'll quickly quickly we might still deploy it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,But you'll very quickly learn not to use them.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And so there'll be like this balance that you humans are very clever as a species.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It's interesting.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"We exploit the resources as much as we can, but we don't we avoid destroying ourselves, it seems like,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"well, I don't know about that actually,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,hope it continues.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I mean, I'm definitely like concerned about nuclear weapons, and so on, not just as a result of the recent conflict, even before that, that's probably my number one concern for facility.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So if humanity destroys itself, or destroys, you know, 90% of people that would be because of nukes?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I think so.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it's not even about full destruction.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"To me, it's bad enough.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"If we reset society, that would be like, terrible.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It'd be really bad.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I can't believe we're, like, so close to it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, it's like so crazy.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,To me.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It feels like we might be a few tweets away from something like that.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yep.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Basically, it's extremely unnerving.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But and has been for me for a long time.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It seems unstable, that world leaders just having a bad mood, can like, take one step towards a bad direction and it escalates.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, because of a collection of bad moods, it can escalate without being able to stop.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, it's just it's a huge amount of power.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then also with the proliferation of basically I don't, I don't actually really see, I don't actually know what the good outcomes are here.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So I'm definitely worried about that a lot.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then AGI is not currently there.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But I think at some point will more and more become something like it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,The danger with AGI even is that I think it's even less likely worse in the sense that there are good outcomes of AGI.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then the bad outcomes are like an epsilon away, like a tiny one away.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so I think capitalism and humanity and so on will drive for the positive ways of using that technology.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But then if bad outcomes are just like a tiny, like flip a minus sign away.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,That's a really bad position to be in,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,a tiny perturbation of the system results in the destruction of the human species.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So weird line to walk.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I think in general, what's really weird about like the dynamics of humanity, and this explosion we've talked about is just like being st coupling afforded by technology, and just the instability of the whole dynamical system.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I think it just doesn't look good.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Honestly.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yes, that exclusion can be destructive or constructive and the probabilities are nonzero and both","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I'm gonna have to, I do feel like I have to try to be optimistic and so on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And yes, I think even in this case, I still am predominantly optimistic, but there's definitely","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,me too.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Do you think we'll become a multiplanetary species?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Probably yes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But I don't know.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"If it's dominant feature of future humanity, there might be some people on some planets and so on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But I'm not sure if it's like, yeah, if it's like a major player in our culture and so on,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,we still have to solve the drivers of self destruction here on Earth.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So just having a backup on Mars is not going to solve the problem.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So by the way, I love the backup on Mars.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I think that's amazing.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,You should absolutely do that.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And, um, so would you?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Or would you go to Mars?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Personally, no, I do like Earth quite a lot.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I'll go,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"to Mars, I'll go.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I'll tweet at you from,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"maybe eventually, I would, once it's safe enough.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But I don't actually know if it's on my lifetime scale, unless I can extend it by a lot.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I do think that, for example, a lot of people might disappear into virtual realities and stuff like that.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I think that could be the major thrust of sort of the cultural development of humanity, if it survives.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So it might not be, it's just really hard to work in physical realm, and go out there.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I think ultimately, all your experiences are in your brain.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so it's much easier to just disappear into the digital realm.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I think people will find them more compelling, easier, safer, more interesting.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So you're a little bit captivated by virtual reality where the possible worlds where there's the metaverse or some other manifestation of that, yeah.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, it's really interesting.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And so I'm interested just just talking a lot to Carmack.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Where's the?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Where's the thing that's currently preventing that?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I want to be clear, I think what's interesting about future is, it's not that I kind of feel like the variance in the human condition, gross, that's the primary thing that's changing, it's not as much the mean, of the distribution is like the variance of it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So there will probably be people in Mars, and there will be people in VR, and there will be people here on Earth.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's just like, there'll be so many more ways of being.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so I kind of feel like I see it as like a spreading out of the human experience.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"There's something about the internet that allows you to discover those little groups and gravitate to something about your biology likes that kind of world that you find each other,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"and we'll have transhumanists and then we'll have the Amish and they're gonna, everything is just going to coexist.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"You know, the cool thing about it, because I've interacted with a bunch of Internet communities is they don't know about each other.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like, you can have a very happy existence, just like having a very close knit community and not knowing about each other.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,We even use consensus just having traveled to Ukraine.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"There's they don't know so many things about America, you like when you travel across the world, they think you experienced this, too.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"They're certain cultures, they're like they have their own thing going on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,They don't.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So you can see that happening more and more and more and more in the future.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,We are a little communities.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I think so that seems to be the that seems to be how it's going right now.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I don't see that trend, like really reversing.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I think people are diverse, and they're able to choose their own, like path in existence.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I sort of like celebrate that.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so we you spend,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"so much time in the metaverse in the virtual reality, or which community area is a physicalist?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,The physical reality enjoyer?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Or do you see drawing a lot of pleasure and fulfillment in the digital world?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I think currently, the virtual reality is not that compelling.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I do think it can improve a lot.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But I don't really know to what extent, maybe you know, there's actually like even more exotic things you can think about with like neural links or stuff like that.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So currently, I kind of see myself as mostly a team, human person.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I love nature.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I love harmony.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I love people.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I love humanity.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I love emotions of humanity.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I just want to be like in this like solar punk little utopia.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"That's my happy place is my happy place is like, people I love thinking about cool problems surrounded by lush, beautiful, dynamic nature, and secretly high tech in places that count","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,places like they use technology to empower that love for other humans and nature.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I think that's technology used like very sparingly.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I don't love when it sort of gets in the way of humanity in many ways.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I like just people being humans in the way we sort of like, slightly evolved and prefer I think, just by default, people kept","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,asking me because they know you love reading?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Are there particular books that you enjoyed that had an impact on you?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,For silly or for profound reasons that you recommend?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,You mentioned the vital question.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Many, of course, I think in biology as an example, the vital question is a good one.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Anything by MacLean, really, life ascending, I would say is like a bit more potentially representative as like a summary of a lot of the things he's been talking about.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I was very impacted by The Selfish Gene.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I thought that was a really good book that helped me understand altruism as an example and where it comes from and just realizing that you know, the selection is on the level of genes was a huge insight for me at the time, and it's sort of like cleared up a lot of things for me.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"What do you think about the the idea that Ideas are the organisms, the meetups?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Love it 100%?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Are you able to walk around with that notion for a while that, that there is an evolutionary kind of process with ideas as well?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,There absolutely,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,is.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"There's memes just like genes and they compete, and they live in our brains.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,That's beautiful.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Are we silly humans thinking that we're the organisms?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Is it possible that the primary organisms are the ideas?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I would say like the the ideas kind of live in the software, or of like our civilization, in the, in the minds and so on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,We think as humans that the hardware is the fundamental thing.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I human is a hardware entity.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,But it could be the software.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Right?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I would say like, there needs to be some grounding at some point to like a physical reality.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Clone and Andre the software is the thing.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like, is this thing that makes that thing special?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Right?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, I guess you're right.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,But then cloning might be exceptionally difficult.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Like there might be a deep integration between the software and the hardware in which we don't quite understand,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"or from the origin point of view, like what makes me special is more like the the gang of genes that are writing in my chromosomes, I suppose.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Right?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Like they're the replicating unit, I suppose.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"no, but that's just deliver you the thing that makes you special?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Sure.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Well, the reality is, what makes you special is your ability to survive, based on the software that runs on the hardware that was built by the genes.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So the software is the thing that makes you survive, not the hardware.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,All right.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's a little bit of both.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's just like a second layer.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's a new second layer that hasn't been there before the brain.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"They both they both coexist, but","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,there's also layers of the software.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I mean, it's it's not it's a so abstractions, on top of abstractions,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"but okay, so so selfish gene.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And McLean, I would say sometimes, books are like not sufficient.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I like to reach for textbooks, sometimes.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I kind of feel like books are for too much of a general consumption sometime.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And they just kind of like they're too high up in the level of abstraction.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it's not good enough.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So I like textbooks.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I like it the cell, I think the cell was pretty cool.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,That's why also I like the writing of Nick lane is because he's pretty willing to step one level down.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And he doesn't get he sort of he's willing to go there.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But he's also willing to sort of be throughout the stack.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"So he'll go down to a lot of detail, but then he will come back up.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I think he has a biscuit.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I really appreciate that.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"That's why I love college, early college, even high school, just textbooks on the basics of Computer Science and Mathematics of biology of chemistry.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yes, those are they condensed down.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like it's sufficiently general, they can understand the both the philosophy and the details, but also like you get homework problems, and you get to play with it as much as you would if you were in programming stuff.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then I'm also suspicious of textbooks, honestly, because, as an example, in deep learning, there's no like amazing textbooks and the field is changing very quickly.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I imagine the same is true and say, synthetic biology and so on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"These books like the cell are kind of outdated, they're still high level, like, what is the actual real source of truth?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's people in wet labs, working with cells, you know, sequencing genomes, and yeah, actually working with working with it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I don't have that much exposure to that, or what that looks like.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So I still don't fully I'm reading through the cell.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And it's kind of interesting, and I'm learning but it's still not sufficient, I would say in terms of understanding","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,what it's a clean summarization of the mainstream narrative.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, but you have to learn that before you break out.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"At the, towards the cutting edge.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"What is the actual process of working with the cells and growing them and incubating them and, you know, it's kind of like a massive cooking recipes and making sure yourself slows and proliferate.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And then you're sequencing them running experiments.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And just how that works, I think is kind of like the source of truth of at the end of the day, what's really useful in terms of creating therapies and so on.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Now, what are in the future AI textbooks will be because, you know, there's artificial intelligence, a modern approach.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Actually, I haven't read if it's come out the recent version, the recent, there's been a recent addition.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I also saw there's a size of deep learning book, I'm waiting for textbooks that worth recommending worth reading.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, it's tricky.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Because it's like papers, and code code code.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Honestly,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,papers are quite good.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I especially like the appendices appendix of any paper as well.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It's like, it's like the most detail can have.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It doesn't have to be cohesive, connected.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Anything else.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"You just described me very specific ways on to particular thing Yeah,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,many times papers can be actually quite readable.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Not always.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But sometimes the introduction in the abstract is readable even for someone outside of the field.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Not this is not always true.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And sometimes I think unfortunately, scientists use complex terms even when it's not necessary.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I think that's harmful.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I think there's no reason for that.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And the papers, sometimes they're longer than they need to be in this in the parts that don't matter.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, Appendix would be long.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"But then the papers of you know, look at Einstein make it simple.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Give us only I've come across papers, I would say, say like synthetic biology or something that I thought were quite reasonable for the abstract and the introduction, and then you're reading the rest of it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And you don't fully understand, but you kind of are getting a gist.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I think it's cool.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"What advice you give advice to folks interested in machine learning and research, but in general life advice to young person high school, early college about how to have a career that can be proud of or life that can be proud of?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I think I'm very hesitant to give general advice.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I think it's really hard.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I've mentioned like some of the stuff I've mentioned, is fairly general, I think, like focus on just the amount of work you're spending on like a thing.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Compare yourself to only to yourself, not to others.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,That's good.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I think those are fairly general,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,how do you pick the thing?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,You just have like a deep interest in something.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Or like, try to like find the arg max over like, the things that you're interested in arg max","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"at that moment, and stick with it?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,How do you not get distracted?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And switch to another thing?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"You can if you like,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"we, if you do an arg max repeatedly, every week","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,doesn't converge?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's a problem.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, you can like low pass filter yourself in terms of like, what has consistently been true for you.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But yeah, I definitely see how it can be hard.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But I would say like, you're going to work the hardest on the thing that you care about the most.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So low pass filter yourself and really introspect in your past are the things that gave you energy?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And what are the things that took that energy away from you concrete examples.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And usually, from those concrete examples, sometimes parents can emerge.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I like I like it when things look like this, when I'm these positions.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,That's not,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"necessarily the field, but the kind of stuff you're doing in a particular field.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So for you, it seems like you were energized by implementing still building actual things.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, being low level learning, and then also communicating so that others can go through the same realizations and shortening that gap.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Because I usually have to do way too much work to understand a thing.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And then I'm like, Okay, this is actually like, Okay, I think I get it, and like, why was it so much work?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It should have been much less work.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And that gives me a lot of frustration.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And that's why I sometimes go teach.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So aside from the teaching, you're doing now, putting our videos, aside from a potential Godfather Part Two, with the AGI at Tesla and beyond?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What is the future for Andre Carpathia hold?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Have you figured that out yet?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Or no?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I mean, as you see through the fog of war, that is all of our future?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Do you start seeing silhouettes of what that possible future could look like?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"The consistent thing I've been always interested in, for me, at least is AI.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And that's probably where I'm spending my the rest of my life on, because I just care about it a lot.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And actually care about like many other problems as well, like, say, aging, which I basically view as disease.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I care about that as well.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,But I don't think it's a good idea to go after it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Specifically, I don't actually think that humans will be able to come up with the answer, I think the correct thing to do is to ignore those problems, and you solve AI, and then use that to solve everything else.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I think there's a chance that this will work, I think it's a very high chance.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And that's kind of like the, the way I'm betting at least","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"so when you think about AI, are you interested in all kinds of applications, all kinds of domains, and any domain you focus on will allow you to get insights.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Now the big problem of AGI,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,here for me is the ultimate meta problem.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I don't want to work on any one specific problem, there's too many problems.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So how can you work on all problems simultaneously?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"You solved the meta problem, which to me is just intelligence and how do you automate it?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Is there,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"cool small projects like archive sanity, and, and so on that you're thinking about the, the world the ML world can anticipate.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,There's some always like some fun side projects.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Archives sanity is one of the basically like, there's way too many archive papers, how can I organize it and recommend papers and so on?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I transcribed all of your podcasts,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,what did you learn from that experience?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,From transcribing the process of like you like consuming audiobooks and podcasts and so on?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Anyway, here's the process that achieves closer to human level performance on meditation.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"well, I definitely was like surprised that transcription with opening eyes whisper was working so well, compared to what I'm familiar with from Siri and like a few other systems.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I guess.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It works so well.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And that's what gave me some energy to like, try it out.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I thought it could be fun to random podcasts.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's kind of not obvious to me why whisper is so much better compared to anything else?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Because I feel like there should be a lot of incentive for a lot of companies to produce transcription systems and that they've done so over a long time.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Whisper is not a super exotic model.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's a transformer.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It takes Mel spectrograms and, you know, just outputs tokens of texts, not crazy.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,The model and everything has been around for a long time.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I'm not actually 100% sure why,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,you Not it's not obvious to me either.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,It makes me feel like I'm missing something.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I'm missing something.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Because there's a huge move in Google and so on YouTube transcription.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, it's unclear, but some of it is also integrating into a bigger system.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, that is, so the user interface, how's deployed all that kind of stuff, maybe running it as an independent thing is eat much easier, like an order of magnitude easier than deploying to a large integrated system, like YouTube transcription or anything like meetings, Zoom has transmit transcription.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,That's kind of crappy.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"But creating an interface where the text the different individual speakers, it's able to display it in compelling ways run in real time, all that kind of stuff.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Maybe that's difficult.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,That's the only explanation I have.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Because like, I'm currently paying quite a bit for human transcription, human caption, right annotation.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like, it seems like there's a huge incentive to automate that.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It's very confusing, I","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,think.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I mean, I don't know if you'd looked at some of the Whisper transcripts, but they're quite good.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,They're good.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And especially in tricky cases, I've seen whispers performance on like, super tricky cases.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And it does incredibly well.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So I don't know, a podcast is pretty simple.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"It's like high quality audio, and you're speaking usually pretty clearly.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So I don't know it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I don't know what open as plans are.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, either.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But yeah, there's always like fun, fun projects, basically.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And stable diffusion also is opening up a huge amount of experimentation, I would say in the visual realm, and generate generating images and videos and movies, like videos now.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so that's going to be pretty crazy, that's going to that's going to almost certainly work.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And it's going to be really interesting when the cost of content creation is going to fall to zero.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,He used to need a painter for a few months to paint a thing.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And now he's going to be speak to your phone to get your video.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So Hollywood will start using that to generate scenes.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Which completely opens up.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, so you can make like a movie like Avatar, eventually, for under a million dollars,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,much less maybe just by talking to your phone?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I mean, I know it sounds kind of crazy.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"And then there'll be some voting mechanism, like how do you have an like, will there be a show on Netflix as generated completely?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Automatically?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,So naturally?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And what does it look like also, when you can just generate on demand?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And it's, and there's infinity of it?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,All the synthetic art.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I mean, it's humbling because we treat ourselves as special for being able to generate art and ideas and all that kind of stuff.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"If that can be done in an automated way, by AI.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I think it's fascinating to me how these, the predictions of AI and what it's going to look like and what's going to be capable of are completely inverted and wrong.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And sci fi of 50s and 60s was just like, totally not right.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Imagine AI is like, super calculating theory improvers.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And we're getting things that can talk to you about emotions, it can do art.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,It's just like weird.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Are you sad about that future just has, like, hybrid systems, heterogeneous systems of humans and AIS talking about emotions, Netflix and chill with an AI system.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Legit word.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,The Netflix thing you watch is also generated by AI.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I think it's a it's going to be interesting for sure.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And I think I'm cautiously optimistic, but it's not it's not obvious.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Well, the","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"sad thing is your brain and mine developed in a time where before Twitter before the before the internet, so I wonder people that are born inside of it might have a different experience?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like I maybe you can, will still resist it.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And the people born now will not?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Well, I do feel like humans are extremely malleable.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Yeah.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And you're probably right.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,What is the meaning of life?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Andre?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,We talked about sort of the universe having a conversation with us humans are would the systems we create to try to answer for the universe?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,For the creator of the universe to notice us?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,We're trying to create systems that are allowed enough.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,Just answer back.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I don't know if that's the meaning of life.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,That's like meaning of life.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,For some people.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,The first level answer I would say is anyone can choose their own meaning of life because we are conscious entity and it's beautiful.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Number one, but I do think that like a deeper meaning of life, if someone is interested, is are along the lines of like, What the hell is Elvis?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And like why?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And if you look at the into fundamental physics and the quantum field theory in the Standard Model, they're like, we're very complicated.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And there's this like 19 free primer parameters of our universe.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And like, what's going on with all this stuff?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And why is it here and can I hack it?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Can I work?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"with it, is there a message for me?","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,Am I supposed to create a message?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And so I think there's some fundamental answers there.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But I think there's actually even like, you can't actually really make a dent in those without more time.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And so to me also, there's a big question around just getting more time, honestly.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, that's kind of like what I think about quite a bit as well.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"So kind of the ultimate, or at least first way to sneak up to the why.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Question is to try to escape the system, the universe, and then for that, you sort of backtrack and say, okay, for that, that's going to be take a very long time.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,So the wide question boils down from an engineering perspective to how do we extend?,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, I","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"think that's the question number one, practically speaking, because you can't, you're not going to calculate the answer to the deeper questions in time you have.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And that could be extending your own lifetime or extending just the lifetime of human civilization,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,of whoever wants to not many people might not want that.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But I think people who do want that, I think, I think it's probably possible.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And I don't think I don't know that people fully realize this.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I kind of feel like people think of death as an inevitability.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"But at the end of the day, this is a physical system, some things go wrong.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"It makes sense why things like this happen, evolutionarily speaking.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,And there's most certainly interventions that that mitigate it.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,That'd be interesting.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"If death is eventually looked at as, as a fascinating thing that used to happen to humans.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,I don't,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,think it's unlikely.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"I think it's, I think it's likely.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,And it's up to our imagination to try to predict what the world without death looks like.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, it's hard to, I think the values will completely change.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"To be, I don't, I don't really buy all these ideas that Oh, without that there's no meaning.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"There's nothing as I don't intuitively by all those arguments, I think there's plenty of meaning plenty of things to learn.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"They're interesting, exciting, I want to know, I want to calculate, I want to improve the condition of all the humans and organisms that are alive.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,The way we find meaning might change.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"We there is a lot of humans, probably including myself, that finds meaning in the finiteness of things.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,But that doesn't mean that's the only source of meaning.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Yeah, I think many people will, will go with that, which I think is great.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,I love the idea that people can just choose their own adventure.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"Like you, you are born as a conscious free entity, by default, I like to think and you have your unalienable rights for life.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,In the,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"pursuit of happiness, proceed, I don't know.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"The nature the landscape of happiness,","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,and you can choose your own adventure mostly.,"Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Andrej Karpathy,"And that's not fully true, but","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
Lex Fridman,"I still am pretty sure I'm an NPC, but an NPC can't know it's an NPC.","Andrej Karpathy - Tesla AI, Self-Driving, Optimus, Aliens, and AGI .txt"
