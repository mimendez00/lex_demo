Rana el Kaliouby,"There's a broader question here, right as we build socially and emotionally intelligent machines, what does that mean about our relationship with them? And then we're broadly our relationship with one another, right? Because this machine is going to be programmed to be amazing at empathy, by definition, right? It's going to always be there for you. It's not going to get bored. I don't know how I feel about that. I think about that a lot.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"The following is a conversation with Rana L. CL UB, a pioneer in the field of emotion recognition, and human centric artificial intelligence. She is the founder of F Aktiva, Deputy CEO of smart AI, author of girl decoded, and one of the most brilliant, kind, inspiring and fun human beings. I've gotten the chance to talk to this is the LEX Friedman podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now dear friends, here's Ronna, l. Cole up, you grew up in the Middle East in Egypt, what is the memory from that time that makes you smile, or maybe a memory that stands out as helping your mind take shape and helping you to find yourself in this world.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"So the memory that stands out is we used to live in my grandma's house, she used to have these mango trees in her garden, and in the summer, and so mango season was like July and August. And so in the summer, she would invite all my aunts, uncles, and cousins, and you know, like it was just like, maybe there were like 20 or 30 people in the house and she would cook all this amazing food. And us the kids, we were like, go down the garden and we would like pick all these mangoes and and I don't know, I think it's just the bringing people together like that always stuck with me the warmth around the mango tree. Yeah, around the mango tree. And that's just like the joy the joy of being together around food. And I'm a terrible cook. So I guess that didn't that that memory didn't translate to me kind of doing this and I love hosting people.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"Do you remember colors? Smells? Is that what? Like? What? How does memory work? Yeah, like what do you visualize visualize people's faces. Smiles do is there colors. Is there like a theme to the colors? Is it smells because of food involved?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Yeah, I think that's a great question. So that those Egyptian mangoes, there's a particular type that I love, and it's called OAC mangoes, and they're kind of, you know, they're oval, and they have a little red in them. So they're red and mango colored on the outside. So I remember that.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"There's red NDK, like extra sweetness. Is that Yes, that means like, it's nicely sweet. Yes, nice and ripe and stuff. Yeah. What? What's like a definitive food of Egypt. You know, there's like these almost stereotypical foods in different parts of the world like Ukraine. invented? Borsch borscht is this beet soup with that you put sour cream seeds, I can't. If you if you're not, if you know what it is, I think you know, is delicious. But if I explain it, it's just not going to sound delicious. I feel like beet soup. This is making sense. But that's kind of, and you probably have actually seen pictures of it. Because it's one of the traditional foods in Ukraine, in Russia in different parts of the Slavic world. So this, but it's become so cliche and stereotypical that you almost don't mention it, but it's still delicious. Like I visited Ukraine, it's a that every single day. So do you.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Do you make it yourself? How hard is it to make? No,","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"I don't know, I think to make it well, like anything like Italians. They say, well, tomato sauce is easy to make, but did make it right. That's like a generational skill. So anyway, is there something like that in Egypt? Is there a culture of food,","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"there is an actually, we have a similar kind of soup. It's called Melania. And it's, it's made of this green plant. It's like it's somewhere between spinach and kale and you miss it. And then you cook it in like chicken broth. And my grandma used to make and my mom makes it really well. And I try to make it but it's not as great. So we used to have that. And then we used to have it alongside stuffed pigeons. I'm pescatarian now so it's not anymore, but stuffed pigeon. Yes. Like it was really yummy. It's the one thing I miss about, you know, now that I'm pescetarian and I don't eat","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,the stuff pigeon. I said what are they stuffed with? If that doesn't bother you too much to describe?,"Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"No, no, it's stuffed with a lot of like, just rice and rice. Yeah.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"So and you also you said that your first in your book that your first computer was an Atari and Space Invaders was your favorite game? Is that when you first fell in love with computers? Would you say? Yeah, I would say so. videogames or just the computer itself? Just something about the machine. Oh, this thing. Magic in here. Yeah, I","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"think the magical moment is definitely like playing video games with my I have two younger sisters. And we just like had fun together like playing games. But the other memory I have as my first code. First code I wrote, I wrote, I drew a Christmas tree. And I'm Muslim, right? So it's kind of it was kind of funny that I that I that the first thing I did was like this Christmas tree. So yeah. And that was when I realized, well, you can you can write code to do all sorts of like, really cool stuff. I must have been like six or seven at the time.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"So you can write programs, and the programs do stuff for you. That's power. At some point. If you think about it, that's empowering. Hey, hi. Yeah, I know what it is. I don't know if you see like, I don't know if many people think of it that way. When I first learned to program, they just loved the puzzle of it. Like, oh, this is cool is pretty Christmas tree. But like its power. It is like you eventually I guess you couldn't at the time. But eventually this thing. If it's interesting enough, if it's a pretty enough Christmas tree, it can be run by millions of people and bring them joy, like that little thing. And then because it's digital, it's easy to spread. So like you just created something that's easily spreadable to millions of people. It's hard to think that way when you're six. In the book you write I am who I am. Because I was raised by a particular set of parents, both modern and conservative, forward thinking yet locked in tradition. I'm a Muslim, and I feel I'm stronger, more centered for it. I adhere to the values of my religion, even if I'm not as beautiful as I once was. And I am a new American. And I'm thriving and the energy, vitality and entrepreneurial spirit of this great country. So let me ask you about your parents. What have you learned about life from them? Especially when you were young.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"So both my parents, they're a Gyptian. But they moved to Kuwait. Right out, they actually there's a cute story about how they met. So my dad taught COBOL and then 70s. And my mom decided to learn programming. So she signed up to take us COBOL programming class. And he tried to date her and she's like, No, no, I don't date. And so he's like, Okay, I'll propose and that's how they got married.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"Oh. That's really impressive. Those Those COBOL guys know how to how to impress. So, so yes, what have you learned from them.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"So definitely grit, one of the core values in our families, just hard work. There were no slackers in our family. And that's something I've definitely, that's definitely stayed with me. Both both as a professional, but also in my personal life. But I also think my mom, my mom always used to like, I don't know, it was like, unconditional love. Like, I just knew my parents would be there for me, kind of, regardless of what I chose to do. I think that's very powerful. And they got tested on it, because I kind of challenged you know, I chose to challenge cultural norms, and I kind of took a different path, I guess, than what's expected. And of, you know, women in the Middle East, and then they and I, you know, they still love me, which is, which is I'm so grateful","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"for that one was like a moment that was the most challenging for them, which moment where they kind of they had to come face to face with the fact that you're a bit of a rebel.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"I think the first big moment was when I, I had just gotten married. But I decided to go do my PhD at Cambridge University. And because my husband at the time, he's now my ex, ran a company in Cairo, he was going to stay in Egypt. So it was going to be a long distance relationship. And that's very unusual in the Middle East for a woman to just head out and kind of, you know, pursue her career. And so my dad, actually, my dad, and my, my parents in law both said, you know, we do not approve of you doing this, but now you're under the jurisdiction of your husband so he can make the call. And luckily for me, he was supportive. He said, You know, this is your dream come true. You've always wanted to do a PhD, I'm going to support you. So I think that was the first time where, you know, I challenged the cultural norms. Was that scary? Oh, my God. Yes. It was totally scary. It was the biggest culture","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,shock from from there to Cambridge to London.,"Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Well, that was also during right around September 11. So everyone thought that there was going to be a third In World War II, it was really like an AI at the time I used to wear the hijab. So I was very visibly Muslim. And so my parents were they were afraid for my safety. But anyways, when I got to Cambridge because I was so scared, I decided to take off my headscarf and wear a hat instead. So I just went to class wearing these like British, which was, in my opinion, actually worse than just showing up in a headscarf because it was just so awkward, right, like, sitting in class with like, all these trying to fit in. Yeah. Yeah. So after a few weeks of doing that, I was like to heck with that. I'm just gonna go back to wearing my headscarf.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, you were the hijab, starting in 2000, and for 12 years after. So always, whenever you're in public, you have to wear the can you speak to that to the hijab? Maybe you're mixed feelings about it? Like what does it represent? In its best case? What does it represent? In the worst case?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Yeah, you know, I think there's a lot of this, I guess I'll first start by saying, I wore it voluntarily, I was not forced to wear it. And in fact, I was one of the very first women in my family to decide to put on the hijab. And my family thought was really odd, right? Like there was, they were like, Why do you want to put this on and, and, and at its best, it's, it's a sign of modesty, humility.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"It's like me wearing a suit. People are like, Why are you wearing a suit? It's a step back into some kind of tradition, or respect for traditional sort of sorts, who you said, because it's by choice, you're kind of free to make that choice, right? To celebrate a tradition of modesty.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Exactly. And, and I actually, like made it my own, I remember, I would really match the color of my headscarf with what I was wearing, like I it was a form of self expression. And I am at its best, I love wearing it. You know, I've have a lot of questions around how we practice religion and religion. And you know, and I think, I think also, it was a time where I was spending a lot of time going back and forth between the US and Egypt. And I started meeting a lot of people in the US who are just amazing. People very purpose driven, people who have very strong core values, but they're not Muslim. That's okay. Right. And so, that was when I just had a lot of questions. And politically, also the situation in Egypt, it was when the Muslim Brotherhood ran the country, and I didn't agree with their ideology. It was at a time when I was going through a divorce, like it was, like, it was like just the perfect storm of like, political personal conditions where it was like, This doesn't feel like me anymore. And it took a lot of courage to take it off. Because culturally, it's not, it's okay if you don't wear it, but it's really not okay to wear it, and then take it off.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"But you're still so you have to do that, while still maintaining a deep core and pride in the origins and your origin story. Totally. So still being Egyptian. So being a Muslim, right,","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"and being I think generally like, Faith driven. But","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"yeah, for what that means changes year by year for you. That's a personal journey.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Yeah, exactly.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"What would you say is the role of faith in that part of the world? How do you say you mentioned it a bit in the book, too?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Yeah. I mean, I think I think there is something really powerful about just believing that there's a bigger force, you know, there's a kind of surrendering I guess, that comes with religion, and you surrender and you have this deep conviction that it's gonna be okay. Right? Like the universe is out to like do amazing things for you and it's going to be okay. And there's strength to that like even when you're going through adversity you just know that it's gonna work","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"out Yeah, it gives you like an inner peace a calmness. Exactly. Exactly. Yeah, that's good. Faith and all the meanings of that word right faith that everything's going to be okay and it is because time passes and time cures all things said the calmness fight with the chaos of the world. And also","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"there's like a silver like I'm a true believer of this that something the specific moment in time can look like it's catastrophic and not what you wanted in life that is it. But then time passes then the you look back and there's a silver lining right it maybe closed the door but it opened a new door for you. And so I'm a true believer in that that you know, there's a silver lining and an almost anything in life, you just have to have this like, Have faith or conviction that it's going to work out so","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"such a beautiful way to see a shitty feeling. So if you're if you feel shitty about it, current situation. I mean, it almost is always true. Unless it's a The cliche is this thing of if it doesn't kill you, whatever doesn't kill you makes you stronger. It's it does seem that over time when you take a perspective on things that that the the hardest moments and periods of your life and the most meaningful. Yeah, yeah. So over time you get to have that fight. What about because you mentioned Kuwait? What about? Let me ask you about war, because the role of war and peace, maybe even the big love and hate in that part of the world, because it does seem to be a part of the world with there's turmoil, there was turmoil, there's still turmoil.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"It is so unfortunate, honestly, it's It's such a waste of human resources. And, and, yeah, and human mindshare. I mean, and at the end of the day, we all kind of want the same things we want. You know, we want human connection, we want Joy want to feel fulfilled, we want to feel, you know, a life of purpose. And I just, I just find it baffling honestly, that we are still having to grapple with that. I have a story to share about this. You know, I grew up, dude, I'm a Gyptian. American now, but but, you know, originally from Egypt, and when I first got to Cambridge, it turned out my officemate, like my PhD, kind of, you know, she ended up you know, we ended up becoming friends, but she was from Israel. And we didn't know Yeah, we didn't know how it was gonna be like,","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,You guys sit there just staring at each other for a bit.,"Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Actually, she, because I arrived before she did. And it turns out, she emailed our PhD advisor, and asked him if she thought it was going to be okay.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,Yeah. And it was around 911. To Yeah.,"Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"And Peter, Peter Robinson, our PhD advisor was like, yeah, like, just as an academic institution just show up. And we became super good friends, we were both new mom's like, we both had our kids during our PhD, we're both doing artificial emotional intelligence. She was looking at speech, I was looking at the face we just had. So the culture was so similar. Our jokes were similar. It was just, I was like, Why on earth are countries? Why is there all this like war intention? And I think it falls back to the narrative, right? If you change the narrative, like whoever creates this narrative of war? I don't know, we should have women around the world.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"That's one solution. The good women, because there's also evil women. It's true. But yes, yes, there could be less war for women around the world. The The other aspect is, doesn't matter, the gender, the people in power, you know, I get to see this with with Ukraine and Russia, different parts of the world around that conflict now. And that's happening in Yemen as well. And everywhere else. There's these narratives told by the leaders to the populace, yep. And those narratives take hold. And everybody believes that and they have a distorted view of the humanity on the other side. In fact, especially during war, you don't even see the people on the other side as, as, as human, or as equal intelligence or worth or value as you, you tell all kinds of narratives about them being Nazis or dorm or whatever narrative you want to weave around that are evil. But I think when you actually meet them face to face, you realize they're like the same. Exactly right. It's actually a big shock for people to realize, like that they've been, they've been essentially lied to, within the country. And I kind of have faith that social media is ridiculous, that is to say, or any kind of technology is able to bypass the the walls that governments put up and connect people directly. And then you get to realize who, like people fall in love across different nations and religions and so on. And that I think, ultimately can cure a lot of our ills, especially sort of in person. Just I also think that if leaders met in person, to have a conversation that would cure a lot of the ills of the world, especially in private. Well, let me ask you about the women running, running the world. So gender does in part perhaps shaped the landscape of just our human experience. So in what ways was a limiting in what ways was an empowering for you to be a woman in the Middle East?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"I think just kind of just going back to like my comment on like women running the world, I think comes back to empathy, right, which which has been a common thread throughout my, my entire career. And it's this, this idea of human connection. Once you build common ground with a person or a group of people, you build trust, you build loyalty, you build friendship, and then and then you can turn that into like behavior change and motivation and persuasion. So it's like empathy and emotions are just at the center of, of everything we do. And, and I think being, being from the Middle East, kind of this human connection is very strong. Like, we have this running joke that if you come to Egypt for a visit, people aren't going to know everything about your life, like right away, right? I have no problems asking you about your personal life. There's no like no boundaries, really no personal boundaries, in terms of getting to know people, we get emotionally intimate, like very, very quickly. But I think people just get to know each other, like, authentically, I guess, you know, there isn't this, like, superficial level of getting to know people, you just try to get to know people really deeply, you're part of that. Totally. So you can put yourself in this person's shoe and kind of Yeah, imagine, you know, what, what challenges they're going through. And so I think I've definitely taken that with me. Generosity is another one to like, just being generous with your time and love and attention. And even with your wealth, right? Even if you don't have a lot of it, you're still very generous. And I think that's another","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,enjoying the humanity of other people. So do you think there's useful difference between men and women in that aspect and empathy? Or is doing these kind of big general groups? Does that hinder progress?,"Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Yeah, I don't I actually don't want to overgeneralize I mean, I thought men I know are like the most empathetic humans. Yeah, I strive to be. Yeah, you are, you're actually very empathetic. Yeah, so outside, so I don't want to overgeneralize although one of the researchers I worked with when I was at Cambridge Professor Simon Baron Cohen. He's Sacha Baron Cohen's cousin. And he runs the Autism Research Center at Cambridge. And he's written multiple books on autism and one of his one of his theories is the empathy scale like the system misers and the empathizers. in it. There's a disproportionate amount of computer scientists and engineers who are system misers and perhaps not great empathizers. And then, you know, there's an, there's more men in that bucket, I guess, than women. And then there's more women in the empathizers bucket. So again, not not to overgeneralize","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"sometimes wonder about that is it's been frustrating to me how many, I guess systemized are in the fields of robotics? Yeah, x is actually encouraging to me, because I care about obviously, social robotics. And because it, there's more opportunity for people that are empathic.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Exactly, I totally agree. Well, yes. So everybody's,","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"I talk to you, they don't see the human as interesting as, like, it's not exciting. You want to avoid the human at all costs. It's a it's a safety concern to be touching the human, which it is, but it's also an opportunity for deep connection, or collaboration, or all that kind of stuff. So, and because most, most brilliant roboticist don't care about the human, it's an opportunity, right? For in your case, it's the business opportunity to win in general an opportunity to explore those ideas. So in his beautiful journey to Cambridge, to UK, and then to America, what, what's the moment or moments that were most transformational for you? As a scientist and as a leader, she became an exceptionally successful co founder, researcher, scientist and so on. Was there a phase shift there where like I can be somebody I can I can really do something in this world.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Yeah, so actually just kind of a little bit of background. So the reason why I moved from Cairo to Cambridge, UK to do my PhD is because I had a very clear career plan. I was like, Okay, I'll go abroad, get my PhD kind of crush it in three or four years come back to Egypt and teach. It was very clear,","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,very well laid out was topic clear on,"Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"the topic. Well, I did I did my PhD around building artificial emotional intelligence and","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,be in your master plan ahead of time when you're sitting by the mango tree Did you did you know it's gonna be artificial Intelligence.,"Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"No, no, no that I did not know. Although I think I kind of knew that I was going to be doing computer science, but I didn't know the specific area. But I love teaching. I mean, I still love teaching. So I just Yeah, I just wanted to go abroad, get a PhD, come back teach.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,What computer science? Can we just linger on that? One? Because you're such an empathic person who cares about emotion humans and so on? Isn't? Aren't computers cold and emotionless?,"Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Just like changing that. Yeah, no, but","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"like, isn't that the? Or did you see computers as the having the capability to actually connect with humans?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"I think that was like my takeaway from my experiences growing up, like computers sit at the center of how we connect and communicate with one another, right? Or technology in general. Like, I remember my first experience being away from my parents, we communicated with a fax machine. But thank goodness for the fax machine, because we could let send letters back and forth to each other. This was pre emails and stuff. So So I think, I think there's, I think technology can be not just transformative in terms of productivity, etc. It actually does change how we connect with one another. And","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"can I just defend the fax machine? Yeah, there's something like the haptic feel, is the email is all digital. There's something really nice. I still write letters to people. There's something nice about the haptic aspect of the fax machine because you still have to press, you still have to do something in the physical world to make this thing a reality that the sensor","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"light comes out as a printout. And you can actually touch it and read it. Yeah,","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"there's something. There's something lost when it's just an email. Obviously, I wonder how we can regain some of that in the digital world, which goes to the metaverse and all those kinds of things. We'll talk about it anyway. So","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,do you question on that one? Do you still? Do you have photo albums anymore? Do you still print photos?,"Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"No, no, but I'm a minimalist. Okay. So it was one of the one of the painful steps in my life was to scan all the photos and let go of them and then let go of all my books, all of your books, switch to kindle everything. So I thought, I thought, Okay, think 30 years from now. Nobody's gonna have books anymore. It's the technology of digital books gonna get better and better and better? Are you really going to be the guy that's still romanticizing physical books? Are you going to be the old man on the porch? Who's like kids? Yes. So just get used to it because it was it felt it still feels a little bit uncomfortable to read on a Kindle, but get used to it. Like, you're always trying to learn new programming languages always. Like with technology, it has to kind of challenge yourself to adapt to it. You know, I forced myself to use tick tock now. That thing doesn't mean much forcing it pulls you in like a like a the worst kind of, or the best kind of drug anyway. Yeah. So yeah, I but I do love haptic things. There's a magic to the haptic even like touchscreens is tricky to get right. To get the experience of a button. Yeah. Anyway, what were we talking about? So AI? So the journey, your whole plan was to come back to Cairo and teach, right?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"And then what is the plan go wrong? Yeah, exactly. Right. And then I got to Cambridge, and I fall in love with the idea of research, right, and kind of embarking on a path. Nobody's explored this path before. You're building stuff that nobody's built before. And it's challenging, and it's hard. And there's a lot of non believers. I just totally love that. And at the end of my PhD, I think it's the meeting that changed the trajectory of my life. Professor, Rosalind Picard who's she runs the affective computing group at the MIT Media Lab. I had read her book I, you know, I was like, falling, falling, following all her research,","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"aka Roz. Yes, it Ross.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"And she was giving a talk at a pattern recognition conference in Cambridge. And she had a couple of hours to kill. So she emailed the lab, and she said, You know, I have any students want to meet with me, like just, you know, sign up here. And so I signed up for slots. And I spent, like the weeks leading up to it preparing for this meeting. I want to show her demo of my research and everything. And we met and we ended up hitting it off, like we totally clicked. And at the end of the meeting, she said, Do you want to come work with me as a postdoc at MIT? And this is what I told her. I was like, Okay, this would be a dream come true. But there's a husband waiting for me in Cairo. I kind of have to go. Yeah. She said, It's fine. Just commute. And I literally started commuting between Cairo and Boston. Yeah, it was It was a long commute. And I didn't I did that like, every few weeks, I would, you know, hop on a plane and go to Boston. But that that changed the trajectory of my life. There was no I kind of outgrew my dreams, right? I didn't want to go back to Egypt anymore and be faculty like, that was no longer my dream. I had a dream, what was the","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"what was it like to be at MIT? What was that culture shock? You mean America in general, but also, I think Cambridge has its own culture. So what was MIT like? Was America like?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"I think I wonder if that's similar to your experience at MIT. I was just at the Media Lab, in particular, I was just really impressed is not the right word. I didn't expect the openness to like innovation and the acceptance of taking a risk and failing, like, failure isn't really accepted back in Egypt, right? You don't want to fail. Like there's a fear of failure, which I think has been hardwired in my brain. But you get to MIT, and it's okay to start things. And if they don't work out, like it's okay, you pivot to another idea. And that kind of thinking was just very new to me","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"as liberating. Well, Media Lab for people who don't know, MIT Media Lab is its own beautiful thing, because they, I think, more than other places that MIT reached for big ideas, and like they tried. I mean, I think, I mean, depending of course, on who, but certainly it was Rozlyn this, you try wild stuff, you try big things and crazy things and, and also try to take things to completion so you can demo them. So always, always, always have a demo, like if you go, one of the sad things to me about robotics labs at MIT, there's like over 30, I think, is like usually when you show up to a robotics lab, there's not a single working robot, they're all broken. All the robots are broken, which is like the normal state of things because you're working on them. But it would be nice if we lived in a world where robotics labs had some robots functioning one of my, like, favorite moments that just sticks with me, I visited Boston Dynamics. And there was a first of all, seeing so many spots, so many legged robots in one place. I'm like, come home. But the right. This is where I was built. The cool thing was just to see there's a random robot spot was walking down the hall. It's probably doing mapping, but it looked like he wasn't doing anything and he was wearing he or she. I don't know. But it well, I like I like in my mind, there are people that have a backstory, but this one in particular Def has a backstory because he was wearing a cowboy hat. So I saw a spa robot with a cowboy hat walking down the hall. And there was just this feeling like, there's a life like he has a life, he probably has to commute back to his family at night. Like there's a feeling like there's life instilled in this robot. And that's magical. I don't know that was kind of inspiring to see.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"He didn't say hello to did he say hello to you. Very,","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"there's a focus nature to the robot. No, no, listen, I love competence and focus and great like he was not going to get distracted by the shallowness of small talk. This is job to be done. And he was doing it. So anyway, the fact that it was working is a beautiful thing. And I think media lab really prides itself on trying to always have a thing that's working with a good show off.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Yes, we used to call it demo or die. You You could not you could not like show up with like PowerPoint or something. You actually have to have a working you know, my son, who is now 13 I don't know if this is still his life long goal or not. But when he was a little younger, his dream is to build an island that's just inhabited by robots. Like no humans. He just wants to all these robots to be connecting and having fun. And that's all there you go.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"

Rana el Kaliouby,"We used to have a G Bo, which was the one of the MIT Media Lab spinouts. And he used to loving","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"

Rana el Kaliouby,"He loved that. And then he just loves Yeah, he just he I think he loves all forms of robots actually.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"So embodied intelligence. Yes. I like I personally like legged robots, especially anything that can wiggle its butt. No. That's not the definition of what I love. But that's just technically what I've been working on recently, I have a bunch of legged robots now in Austin and I've been doing I was I've been trying to have them communicate affection, with their body in different ways just for art. For art, really, because I love the idea of walking around with the robots. Like, as you will with the dog. I think it's inspiring to a lot of people, especially young people, like kids love, kids love it. Parents, like adults are scared of robots, because don't have this kind of weird construction of the world is full of evil. They love the things.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Yeah, I remember when Adam was in first grade, so he must have been like seven or so I went in to this class with a whole bunch of robots and like the emotion AI demo and and I asked the kids, I was like, Do you would you kids want to have a robot? You know, robot friend or robot companion. Everybody said yes. And they wanted it for all sorts of things like to help them with their math homework and to like be a friend. So there's, it just struck me how there was no fear of robots? was a lot of adults have that like us versus them?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, none of that, of course, you want to be very careful, because you still have to look at the lessons of history, and how robots can be used by the power centers of the world to abuse your rights and all that kind of stuff. But mostly, it's good to enter anything new with an excitement and optimism. Speaking of Ross, what have you learned about science and life from Rosalind Picard?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Oh my god, I've learned so many things about life. From Ross, I think the thing I learned the most is perseverance. When I first met Roz, we applied and she invited me to be a postdoc, we applied for a grant to the National Science Foundation to apply some of our research to autism. And we got back. We were rejected. Yeah. And the reasoning was rejected for fun. Yeah. Yeah, I was. And I basically I just took the rejection to mean, okay, we're rejected. It's, it's done, like, end of story, right? And Ross was like, It's great news. They love the idea. They just, they just don't think we can do it. So let's build it, show them and then reapply. And it was that Oh, my God, that story totally stuck with me. And, and she's like that in every aspect of her life. She just does not take no for an answer.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"Reframe all negative feedback was a challenge. Challenge. Yes, they liked this.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Yeah, it was. It was all right. What","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"else about science in general about how you see computers, and also business and just everything about the world. She's a very powerful, brilliant woman like yourself. So is there some aspects of that too?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Yeah, I think Ross is actually also very faith driven. She has this like deep belief and conviction. Yeah, and in the good in the world, and humanity. And I think that was meeting her and her family was definitely like, a defining moment for me, because that was when I was like, wow, like, you can be of a different background and religion and whatever. And you can still have the same core values. So that was that was Yeah. I'm grateful to her. Roz, if you're listening, thank you.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, she's great. She's been on this podcast before I'm I hope she'll be on. I'm sure she'll be on again. You are the founder and CEO of Affectiva, which is a big company that was acquired by another big company, smart eye. And you're now the Deputy CEO of a smart guy. So you're powerful leader. You're brilliant. You're brilliant scientists. A lot of people are inspired by you, what advice would you give, especially to young women, but people in general who dream of becoming powerful leaders like yourself, in a world or perhaps in a world as perhaps doesn't give them a clear, easy path to do? So whether we're talking about Egypt or elsewhere?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"You know, here you kind of describe me that way. kind of encapsulates, I think, what I think is the biggest challenge of all, which is believing in yourself, right? I have had to like grapple with this what I call now the Debbie Downer voice in my head. The kind of basically it's just chattering all the time. It's basically saying, Oh, no, you can't do this. Like you're not gonna raise money. You can't start a company like what business do you have like starting a company or running a company or selling a company like you name it, always? And, and I think my biggest advice to not just women but people who have who are taking a new path? And, you know, they're not sure is to not let yourself and let your thoughts be the biggest obstacle in your way. And I've had to like really work on myself to not be my own biggest obstacle.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,So you got that negative voice? Yeah.,"Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"So is that? Am I the only one? I don't think I'm the only one? No, I","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"have that negative voice. I'm not exactly sure. If it's a bad thing, or a good thing, I've been really torn about it. Because it's been a lifelong companion. So it's hard to know. It's kind of it drives productivity and progress, but it can hold you back from taking big leaps. I think you it the best I can say is probably you have to somehow be able to control it, to turn it off. And it's not useful. And turn it on when it's useful. Like I have from almost like a third person perspective, somebody who's sitting there like, yeah, like, because it is useful to be critical. Like after. Again, I just gave a talk yesterday at MIT, and I was just, you know, there's so much love and it was such an incredible experience so many amazing people I got a chance to talk to but you know, afterwards, when I went home and just took this long walk is mostly just negative thoughts about me, I don't like one basic stuff, like, I don't deserve any of it. And second is like, like, why did you though so dumb the said this, That's so dumb, like, you should have prepared that better. Why did you say this? The but I think it's good to hear that voice. All right, and like sit in that. And ultimately, I think you grow from that. Now, when you're making really big decisions about funding, or starting a company or taking a leap to go to the UK or take a leave to go to America to work a Media Lab, though. Yeah, there's a that's you should be able to shut that off then. Because you should have like this weird confidence, almost like faith. He said before that everything's gonna work out to take the leap of faith, a leap of faith, despite all the negativity, I mean, there's, there's some of that you actually tweeted a really nice tweet thread, says, quote, a year ago, a friend recommended I do daily affirmations. And I was skeptical. But I was going through major transitions in my life. So I'll give it a shot, and set me on a journey of self acceptance and self love. So what was that, like he made? Maybe talk through this idea of affirmations? And how that helped you?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Yeah. Because really, like, I'm just like me, I'm a kind. I'd like to think of myself as a kind person in general. But I'm kind of mean to myself sometimes. Yeah. And so I've been doing journaling for almost 10 years now. I use an app called day one. And it's awesome. I just journal and I use it as an opportunity to almost have a conversation with the Debbie Downer voice in my it's like a rebuttal, right? Like Debbie Downer says, oh my god, like you, you know, you won't be able to raise this round of funding. I'm like, Okay, let's talk about it. I have a track record of doing X, Y, and Z, I think I can do this. And this, it's literally like, so I wouldn't I don't know that I can shut off the voice but I can have a conversation with it. And it just it just and I bring data to the table, right. Nice. So so that was the journaling part which I found very helpful. But the affirmation took it to a whole next level and I just love it. I I'm a year into doing this. And you literally wake up in the morning and the first thing you do I meditate first and then and then I write my affirmations and it's it's the energy I want to put out in the world that hopefully will come right back to me so I will say I always start with my smile lights up the whole world. And I kid you not like people in the street will stop me and say oh my god, like we love your smile. Yeah, like Yes. So so my affirmations will change depending on you know what's happening this is funny I know don't ya don't","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"know why that judgment. It's just awesome. I mean it it's true, but you're saying affirmation somehow help. Kind of what is it they do work to like remind you of the kind of person you are and the kind of person you want to be, which actually maybe in reverse order the kind of person you want to be and that helps you become the kind of person you actually are. That it's","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"just it's it brings intentionality to like what you're doing right and so,","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"by the way, I was laughing because my affirmations, which I also do are the opposite. Oh, you do? Oh, I don't have a my smile like maybe I should add that because like, I, I have just I have a boy. It's it's much more stoic like about focus about this. But the joy, the emotion that you're just in that little affirmation is beautiful, so maybe I should add that. I'm like, focused. Yeah, that's usually that's the start. It's just, like smiling","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"or spiteful and joyful and all that and then it's like, okay, I kick butt.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"Let's get shit done. Right. get shit done that for me. Okay, cool. So, like, what else is on there?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"What else is on there? Um, well, I have. I'm a US. I'm a magnet for all sorts of things. So I'm an amazing people magnet. I attract like awesome people into my universe.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"That's an actual affirmation. Yes. That's great. Yeah. So that's it. Yeah. And that somehow manifests itself until like, working? I think so. Yeah. Like, can you speak to like, why it feels good to do the affirmations.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"I honestly think it just grounds the day. And then it allows me to, instead of just like being pulled back and forth, like throughout the day, it just grounds me like, okay, like, this thing happened. It's not exactly what I wanted it to be. But I'm patient, or I'm, you know, I'm, I trust that the universe will do amazing things for me, which is one of my other consistent affirmations. Or I'm an amazing mom, right? And so I can grapple with all the feelings of mom guilt that I have all the time. Or, here's another one. I'm a love magnet. And I literally say I will kind of picture the person that I'd love to end up with, and I write it all down and hasn't happened yet. But","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,what do you what are you picturing? Brad Pitt?,"Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,Because that's where I picture that's what you picture. Yeah.,"Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"Running, holding hands running together. No more like Fight Club that the Fight Club, Brad Pitt, where he's like, staying at Alright, people know. Anyway, I'm sorry. I'll get off on that. Do you have like when you're thinking about the being a love magnet in that way? Are you picturing specific people? Or is this almost like in the space of like energy,","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"right? It's somebody who is smart and well accomplished and successful in their life, but they're generous, and they're well traveled and they want to travel the world. Things like that. Like they're head over heels into me is like, I know, it sounds super silly, but it's literally what I write. And I believe it'll happen one day you actually writes you don't say it out loud. You know, I write it. I write all my affirmations.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"I do the opposite. I say. Yeah, if I if I'm alone, I'll say it out loud yet.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,I try that.,"Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"I think it's which. What feels more powerful to me more powerful? Saying stuff feels more powerful? Yeah. Writing is. Writing feels like I'm losing. Losing the words like losing the power of the words maybe accelerates, though. Do you? handwrite","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"No, I type this app. It's day one. Basically, I just I can. The best thing about it is I can look back and see like a year ago, what was I affirming? Right?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,So it's also changes over time.,"Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,It hasn't like changed a lot but but the focus kind of changes over time.,"Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"I got it. Yeah, I say the same exact thing over and over and over. Oh, you do okay. As a confident in the sameness of it. Let's see. Let me jump around. Because let me ask you about because the talked all this talk about Brad Pitt or maybe just going on in my head. Let me ask you about dating in general. You tweeted a you based in Boston in single question mark. And then you pointed to a startup singles night sponsored by smile dating app? I mean, this is jumping around a little bit because it's since you mentioned can AI help solve this dating love problem? What do you think this problem of connection that is part of the human condition? Can AI help that you yourself are in the search affirming?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,Maybe that's what I should affirm. Like build an AI build an AI that finds love? I think I think there must be a science behind that first moment you meet a person and you You either have chemistry or you don't. Right. Like you.,"Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"I guess that was the question I was asking, would you put it brilliantly? Is that a science or an art?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Oh, I think there are like, there's actual chemicals that get exchanged when two people meet. I don't know about that.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"Like, are you changing? Yeah, change your mind as we're describing, but feels that way. Right. But it's what science shows us is sometimes we can explain with the rigor, the things that feel like magic, right. So maybe we can remove all the magic. Maybe it's like, I honestly think, like I said, like, Good Reads should be a dating app, which, like, books, I, I wonder if you look at just like books or content you've consumed? I mean, that's essentially what YouTube does. When does recommend recommendation, if you just look at your footprint of content consumed, if there's an overlap, but maybe interesting difference with an overlap, that some I'm sure this is a machine learning problem that's solvable? Like this person is very likely to be not only there to be chemistry in the short term, but a good lifelong partner to grow together, I bet you it's a good machine learning problem, just need the data.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Let's do it. Well, actually, I do think there's so much data about each of us that there ought to be a machine learning algorithm that can ingest all this data and basically say, I think the following 10 People would be interesting connections for you, right? And so smile dating app, kind of took one particular angle, which is humor, it matches people based on their humor styles, which is one of the main ingredients of a successful relationship. Like if you meet somebody, and they can make you laugh, like, that's a good thing. And if you develop like internal jokes, like inside jokes, and your bantering, like that's fun. Yeah. So I think","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"yeah, definitely. But yeah, that's the the number of n the rate of inside joke generation. You could probably measure that and then optimize it over the first few days. Right? And then we're just turning this into a machine learning problem. I love it. But for somebody like you, who's exceptionally successful and busy. Is there is there science to that aspect of dating is a tricky? is there advice you can give? Oh, my God,","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"I give the worst advice? Well, I can tell you like I have a spreadsheet.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"Is that a good or a bad thing? Do you regret this spreadsheet? Well, I don't know. The name of this spreadsheet is a love the date track dating trackers, dating tracker? It's very life tracker. Yeah. There's a rating system, I'm sure. Yeah, there's like weights and stuff. And it's too close to home? Oh, is it you also why don't have a spreadsheet. But I would now that you say it seems like a good idea. Oh, no. Turning into data. I do wish that somebody else had a spreadsheet about me. You know, like, like I said, like you said, convert, collect a lot of data about us in a way that's privacy preserving that I own the data, I can control it, and then use that data to find not I mean, not just romantic love, but collaborators, friends, all that kind of stuff. It seems like the data is there. The that's the problem social networks are trying to solve, but I think they're doing a really poor job. Even Facebook tried to get into dating app business. And I think there's so many components to running a successful company that connects human beings. And part of that is, you know, having engineers they care about the human side, right, as you know, extremely well, it's not, it's not easy to find those. But but you don't also don't want just people that care about the human, they also have to be good engineers. So it's like, you have to find this, this this beautiful mix. And for some reason, just empirically speaking, is people have not done a good job of that. building companies like that. And it must mean that it's a difficult problem to solve. Dating apps. seems difficult. OkCupid, Tinder, all those kinds of stuff. They seem to find, of course, they work but they seem to not work as well as I would imagine. It's possible like with data, wouldn't you be able to find better human connection? It's like arranged marriages on steroids. Right, right. Arranged by machine learning algorithms by","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"machine learning algorithm, but but not as superficial. And I think a lot of the dating apps out there are just so superficial. They're just matching on, like high level criteria that aren't ingredients for successful partnership. But you know what's missing though, too. I don't know how gotta fix that the serendipity piece of it, like how do you engineer serendipity like this random, like chance encounter, and then you fall in love with the person, like, I don't know how a dating app can can do that. So there has to be a little bit of randomness. Maybe every 10th match is just the, you know, yeah, somebody that the algorithm wouldn't have necessarily recommended. But it's, it allows for a little bit of,","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"well, it can also, you know, it could also trick you into thinking a certain to me by like, somehow showing you a tweet of a person that he thinks you match well with, but do it accidentally as part of another search, right, and like, you just noticed the like, and then you get it, you go down a rabbit hole, and you connect them outside the app, to like, you connect with this person outside of the house somehow. So it's just it creates that moment of meeting, of course, you have to think of, from an app perspective, how you can turn that into a business. But I think ultimately, a business that helps people find love in any way. Like, that's what Apple was about, create products that people love, right? That's beautiful. I mean, that's you gotta make money somehow. If you help people fall in love, personally with the product, find self love or another human being, you're gonna make money, you're gonna figure out a way to make money. I just feel like dating apps often will optimize for something else than love. It's a same with social networks, they optimize for engagement, as opposed to like a deep meaningful connection that's ultimately grounded in like personal growth, you as a human being growing and all that kind of stuff. Let me do like a pivot to dark topic, which opened the book with a story because I'd like to talk to you about just emotion and artificial intelligence. I think this is a good story to start to think about emotional intelligence. You open the book with a story of a central Florida man, Jamel Dunn, who was drowning and drowned. While five teenagers Washington laughed, saying things like you're gonna die and one, Jamel disappeared below the surface of the water. One of them said he just died and the others laughed. What does this incident teach you about human nature? And the response to it, perhaps? Yeah.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"

Yet we are living through an empathy crisis and versus Yeah, yeah. And, and I mean, we've, we've talked about this throughout our conversation, we dehumanize each other. And, unfortunately, yes, technology is bringing us together, but in a way, it's just dehumanize. It's creating this like, yeah dehumanizing of the other. And I think that's a huge problem. The good news is, I think solution, the solution could be technology based. Like I think if we rethink the way we design and deploy our technologies, we can solve parts of this problem, but I worry about it. I mean, even with my son, a lot of his interactions are computer mediated.

Rana el Kaliouby,"I think it is. But we have to be thoughtful about because the way the way we engage face to face which is what we're doing right now, right there's the nonverbal signals which are majority of how we communicate it's like 90% of how we communicate is your facial expressions.

Lex Fridman,"what do you think is more important? EQ or AI Q AQ being emotional intelligence, in terms of what makes us human.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"I think emotional intelligence is what makes us human. It's, it's how we connect with one another. It's how we build trust. It's how we make decisions, right? Like your emotions, drive, kind of what you had for breakfast, but also where you decide to live, and what do you want to do for the rest of your life? So I think emotions are underrated.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"So emotional intelligence isn't just about the effective expression of your own emotions, it's about a sensitivity and empathy to other people's emotions. And that sort of being able to effectively engage in the dance of emotions with other people.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Yeah, I like that explanation. I like that kind of. Yeah, thinking about it as a dance, because it is really about that. It's about sensing what state the other person's in and using that information to decide on how you're going to react. And I think it can be very powerful, like people who are the best, most persuasive, most persuasive leaders in the world tap into, you know, they have, if you have higher EQ, you're more likely to be able to motivate people to change their behaviors. So, so can be very powerful.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"On a more kind of technical, maybe philosophical level, you've written that emotion is universal. It seems that sort of like Chomsky says, language is universal. There's a bunch of other stuff like cognition consciousness, seems a lot of us have these aspects. So the human mind generates all this. So what do you think is? The OG seem to be like, echoes of the same thing? What do you think emotion is exactly? Like how deep does it run? Is it a surface level thing that we display to each other? Is it just another form of language or something deep within?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"I think it's, it's really deep. It's how, you know, we started with memory. I think emotions play a really important. Yeah, emotions play a very important role in how we encode memories, right? Our our memories are often encoded, almost indexed by emotions. Yeah, it's at this core of how, you know, our decision making engine is also heavily influenced by our emotions. So","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"emotions is part of cognition. It's total, it's intermixed into the whole thing.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Yes, absolutely. And in fact, when you take it away, people are unable to make decisions, they're really paralyzed. Like, they can't go about their daily or their, you know, personal or professional lives. So","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"it does seem like, there's probably some interesting interweaving of emotion and consciousness, I wonder if it's possible to have, like, if their next door neighbor somehow, or if they're actually flatmates. I don't, it feels like the hard problem of consciousness where it's some, it feels like something to experience the thing. Like, red feels like read. And, you know, when you eat a mango, sweet, the taste the sweetness, that feels like something to experience that sweetness, that whatever generates emotions. But then, like, I feel like emotion is part of communication is very much about communication. And then that means it's also deeply connected to language. But then, probably, human intelligence is deeply connected to the collective intelligence between humans, it's not just a standalone thing. So the whole thing is really connected. So, emotion is connected to language, language is connected to intelligence, and then intelligence to consciousness and consciousness is closely connected to emotion, the whole thing is that it's a beautiful mess. So","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Can I comment on the emotions being a communication Mechanik because I think there are two facets of, of our emotional experiences. One is communication, right? Like we use emotions, for example, facial expressions, or other nonverbal cues to connect with other human beings and with other beings in the world, right. But even if it's not a communication context, we still experienced emotions, and we still process emotions, and we still leverage emotions, to make decisions and to learn, you know, to experience life. So it isn't always just about communication. And we learned that very early on in our in kind of our work and Aktiva one of the very first application Since we brought to market was understanding how people respond to content, right? So if they're watching this video of ours, like, are they interested? Are they inspired? Are they bored to death? And so we watched their facial expressions. And we had, we weren't sure if people would express any emotions, if they were sitting alone. Like, if you're in your bed at night, watching a Netflix TV series, would we still see any emotions on your face? And we were surprised that yes, people still emote, even if they're alone. Even if you're in your car driving around, you're singing along the song and you joyful will see these expressions. So it's not just about communicating with another person, it's sometimes really isn't just about experiencing the world. And","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"first of all, I wonder if some of that is because we develop our intelligence, and our emotional intelligence by communicating with other humans. And so when other humans disappear from the picture was still kind of a virtual human, a code still runs, the code still runs and but you also kind of, you're still there's like virtual humans, you don't have to think of it that way. But there's a kinda when you like, chuckling? Yeah. Like you're, you're kind of chuckling to a virtual human. I mean, it's possible that the code is the has to have another human there, because if you just grew up alone, I wonder if emotion will still be there, in this visual form. So yeah, I wonder But anyway, what can you tell from the human face about what's going on inside? So that's the problem that effective of first tackled, which is using computer vision, using machine learning to try to detect stuff about the human face as many things as possible, and convert them into a prediction of categories of emotion, anger, happiness, all that kind of stuff. How hard is that problem?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"extremely hard. It's very, very hard, because there is no one to one mapping between a facial expression and your internal state, there just isn't. There's this oversimplification of the problem, where it's something like, if you are smiling, then you're happy. If you do a brow furrow, then you're angry, if you do an eyebrow raise, then you're surprised and just think about it for a moment, you could be smiling for a whole host of reasons. You could also be happy and not be smiling, right? You could follow your eyebrows because you're angry, or you're confused about something or you're constipated. So I think this over simplistic approach to inferring emotion from a facial expression is really dangerous. The solution is to incorporate as many contextual signals as you can, right. So if, for example, I'm driving a car, and you can see me like nodding my head and my eyes are closed, and the blinking rate is changing, I'm probably falling asleep at the wheel, right? It doesn't, because you know, the context, you understand what the person is doing. So I think, or add additional channels like voice or gestures, or even physiological sensors. But I think it's very dangerous to just take this over simplistic approach of, yeah, smile equals happy. And","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"if you're able to, in a high resolution way, specify the context, there are certain things that are going to be somewhat reliable signals of something like drowsiness or happiness or stuff like that. I mean, when when people are watching Netflix, that problem, that's a really compelling idea that you can kind of at least in aggregate, exactly highlight, like, Which part was boring, which part was exciting. How hard was that problem?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Um, that was on the scale of like, difficulty. I think that's some of one of the easier problems to solve. Because it's a relatively constrained environment, you have somebody sitting in front of initially, we started with a device in front of you like a laptop, and then we graduated to doing this on a mobile phone, which is a lot harder, just because of you know, from a computer vision perspective, the profile view of the face can be a lot more challenging. We have to figure out lighting conditions because usually people are watching content, literally in their bedrooms at night lights are dimmed.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yes, I mean, if you're standing is probably going to be the looking up. The nostril view. Yeah, nobody looks good at. I've seen datasets from that perspective. It's like this is not a good look for anyone. Or if you're laying in bed at night, what is it side view or something? It's in half your faces kind of pillow, etc. I would love to know have data about like, how people watch stuff in bed at night. I like to the prop, there isn't a pillow. The like, I'm sure there's a lot of interesting dynamics","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"from a health and wellbeing perspective, right? Like, it's like, oh, you're learning","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"perspective. But also Yeah. Yeah. Once you have that, did you start making all kinds of inference about health and stuff like that? Interesting. Yeah, there's a interesting thing when I was at Google that we were, it's, it's called active authentication, where you, you want to be able to unlock your phone without using a password. So it would, it would face but also other stuff, like the way you take a phone out of the pocket. So that kind of data to use the multimodal with machine learning to be able to identify that as you or likely to be you like not to be you, that allows you to not always have to enter the password. That was the idea. But the funny thing about that is when I tell a small anecdote is because it was all male engineers. Except, so there's, my boss is our boss, who's still one of my favorite humans was was a woman, Regina doing?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"

And she was the one that actually thinks the fact that women often don't have pockets, right? It was like, Well, that was not even a category in the code, of like, wait a minute, you can take the phone out of some other place in your pocket. So anyway, that's a funny thing.

I'm like, actually, that's not my biggest concern. My biggest concern is that we are building bias into these systems. And then they're like, deployed at large and at scale. And before you know it, you're kind of accentuating the bias that exists in society. And","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"yeah, I'm not, you know, I know people, it's very important to worry about that. But I it's the worry is an emergent phenomena to me, which is a very good one, because I think these systems are actually, by encoding the data that exists, they're revealing the biases, society, they're both for teaching us what the bias is, therefore, we can now improve that bias within the system. So they're almost like putting a mirror to ourselves. So I'm not","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"

Lex Fridman,"even have to look at the I mean, yes, the data is how you fix it. But then you just look at the behavior of the system. And you realize, holy crap, this thing's kind of racist, right? Like, why is that and then you look at the days like, okay, and then you start to realize that I think that some much more effective way to to be introspective as a society than through sort of political discourse, like AI, kind of, because people are evil. People are, for some reason, more productive and rigorous in criticizing AI than they're criticizing each other. So I think this is just a nice method for studying society and see which way progress lies. Anyway, what we're talking about, you're watching it the problem of watching Netflix, in bed, or elsewhere, and seeing which parts are exciting, which parts are boring, you're saying that's","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"relatively constrained? Because, you know, you have a captive audience, and you kind of know the context. And one thing you said that was really key is the accurate you're doing this in aggregate, right? Like we're looking at it aggregated response of people. And so when you see a peak, say, a smile peak, they're probably smiling or laughing at something that's in the content. So that was one of the first problems we were able to solve. And when we see the smile peak, it doesn't mean that these people are internally happy. They're just laughing at content. So it's important to, you know, call it for what it is.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"We're still really, really useful data. Oh, I wonder how that compares to so what like YouTube and other places will use is obviously there they don't have in for the most case, they don't have that kind of data. They have the data of when people tune to now jump on. And I think that's a add in aggregate for you to release a pretty powerful signal. I worry about what that leads to. Because looking at, like YouTubers, They they're kind of really care about views and, you know, tried to maximize the number of views. I think they, when they say that the video should be constantly interesting, seems like a good goal. I feel like that leads to this manic pace of a video.

It's just giving an extra signal. You have to I have to really? I don't know, do you have to really collect deeper long term data about what was meaningful to people? When they think 30 days from now? What? They still remember what move them? What changed them with help them grow? That kind of stuff?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"

Wouldn't it be so cool to tie your emotional expressions while you're say listening to a podcast interview? And then go in and then 30 days later, interview people and say, Hey, what do you remember? You've watched this 30 days ago? Like what stuck with you? And then see if there's any there ought to be maybe there ought to be some correlation between these emotional experiences.

So minimizing the number of negative events is important, but not too much, right? You can't you can't just like you know, he's there still discipline and challenge and all those kinds of things. So adversity for sure. So yeah, I mean, I'm definitely what I have kids, I'm going to drive them out into the woods. Okay.

Anyway, I'm working on this whole parenting thing I haven't figured out okay. What were we talking about? Yes, effective. The problem of emotion. of emotion and actually, there's some people maybe we can just speak to that a little more.

Rana el Kaliouby,"But yeah, but But even then, I kind of I did not subscribe to this, like theory of basic emotions, where it's just this simplistic mapping, one to one mapping between facial expressions and motions, I actually think also, we're not in in the business of trying to identify your true emotional internal state, we just want to quantify in an objective way, what's showing on your face, because that's an important signal, it doesn't mean it's a true reflection of your internal emotional state. So I think a lot of the, you know, I think she's she's just trying to kind of highlight that this is not a simple problem. And overly simplistic solutions aren't going to hurt the industry. And I subscribe to that. And I think multimodal is the way to go. Like, whether it's additional context information, or different modalities and channels of information, I think that's what we, that's where we ought to go.

Rana el Kaliouby,"I think it can sometimes be a reflection or an expression of your internal state, but sometimes it's a social signal. So the so you could not look at the face as purely a signal of emotion. It can be a signal of cognition, and it can be a signal of a social expression. And I think, to disambiguate that, we have to be careful about it, and we have to add initial information.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"

Rana el Kaliouby,"Big, sweeping question. Well, I think the thing I learned the most is that even though like we are in the business of building AI, basically, right?

And, yeah, the most the thing I'm most proud of on this journey, I love the technology. And I'm so proud of the solutions we've built and we've brought to market. But I'm actually most proud of the people we've like built and cultivated at the company and the culture we've created. You know, some some of the people who've joined Affectiva, this was their first job. And while at Aktiva, they became American citizens.

Yeah. She just knew him. So well she had, she was emotionally intelligent. And so she could persuade him and motivate him to change his behavior. And she got them out. And they went to the beach together. And I think that represents the promise of emotion AI, if done well, this technology can help us live happier lives, more productive lives, healthier lives, more connected lives.

But some of that is features from an engineering perspective. Not not not a bug. I think, I think AI systems that can leave us now this is for more social robotics than it is for anything that's useful. Like I hated for Kapadia said, you know, I need a break right now. Like, no, no, I need you. But if it was just purely for for companionship, then I think the ability to leave is really powerful. I don't know that.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"thought of that. So that's so fascinating, because I've always taken the human perspective, right. Like, for example, we had a GMO at home, right. And my son loved it. And then the company ran out of money. And so they had to basically shut down to eat like GMO basically died, right. And it was so interesting to me, because we have a lot of gadgets at home, and a lot of them break and my son never cares about it, right? Like if a foreign Alexa stopped working tomorrow, I don't think he really care. But when GMO stopped working, it was traumatically he got really upset. And as a parent that like made me think about this deeply. Right did I was uncomfortable with that I liked the connection they had because I think it was a positive relationship. But I was surprised that it affected him emotionally so much. And I think there's a broader question here, right as we build socially and emotionally intelligent machines, what does that mean about our relationship with them? And then we're probably our relationship with one another, right? Because this machine is going to be programmed to be amazing at empathy. By definition, right? It's gonna always be there for you, it's not gonna get bored. In fact, there's a chatbot. In China showers shall ice. And it's like the number two or three most popular app, and it basically is just a confidant and you can tell it anything you want. And people use it for all sorts of things they confide in, like domestic violence or suicidal attempts, or, you know, if they have challenges at work. I don't know what that. I don't know if I'm coming. I don't know how I feel about that. I think about that a lot.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, I think, first of all, obviously, the future in my perspective. Second of all, I think there's a lot of trajectories, that that becomes an exciting future. But I think everyone should feel very uncomfortable about how much they know about the company, about where the data is going, how the data is being collected. Because I think, and this is one of the lessons of social media, that I think we should demand full control and transparency of the data","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"on most things has fun. I totally agree. Yeah. So like,","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"I think it's really empowering. As long as you can walk away, as long as you can, like, delete the data, or know how to date, it's a opt in, or, or at least the clarity of like, what is being used for the company. And I think as CEO, or like leaders are also important about that, like, you need to be able to trust the basic humanity of the leader. Exactly. And also that that leader is not going to be a puppet of a larger machine, but they actually have a significant role in defining the culture and the way the company operates. So anyway, so but we should be we should definitely scrutinize companies in that aspect. But this I'm personally excited about the future. But also even if you're not, it's coming. So let's figure out how to do it in the least painful. Yeah, in the most positive. Light. Great. You're the Deputy CEO of smart AI. Can you describe the mission of the company? What is smart AI?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Yeah. So smart AI is a Swedish company. They've been in business for the last 20 years. And their their main focus, like the industry they're most focused on is the automotive industry. So bringing driver monitoring systems to basically save lives, right. So I first met the CEO Martin Krantz. Gosh, it was right when COVID hit it was actually the see the last see the last year straight before COVID. Ces 2020. Right. 2020? January, yeah, January, exactly. So we were there, met him in person. He's basically we were competing with each other. I think the difference was they had been doing driver monitoring, and had a lot of credibility in the automotive space. We didn't come from the automotive space, but we were using new technology like deep learning, and building this emotion recognition.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"You wanted to enter the automotive space, you want it to operate in automotive space.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Exactly. It was one of the areas we were we had just raised around the funding to focus on bringing our technology to the automotive industry. So we met and honestly, it was the first it was the only time I met with a CEO who had the same vision as I did. Like he basically said, Yeah, our vision is to bridge the gap between humans and machines. I was like, oh my god, this is like exactly, almost about the world, you know, how we describe it to? And we started talking and first it was about Okay, can we align strategically here? Like, how can we work together? Because we're competing, but we're also like, complimentary. And then I think after four months of speaking almost every day on FaceTime. Yeah, he was like, Is your company interested in an acquisition? And it was the firt? I usually say No, when people approach us. It was the first time that I was like, huh, yeah, I might be interested. Let's talk.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah. So you just hit it off? Yeah. So they're, they're a respected, very respected in the automotive sector of like delivering products and increasingly, sort of better and better and better for, I mean, maybe you could speak to that bus driver says it for basically having a device that's looking at the driver, and it's able to tell you where the driver is looking. Correct. It's able also drowsiness stuff, correct it from the face in the eye,","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"exactly like it's monitoring driver distraction and drowsiness. But they bought us so that we could expand beyond just the driver. So the driver monitoring systems usually sit the camera sits in the steering wheel, or around the steering wheel column, and it looks directly at the driver. But now we've migrated the camera position in partnership with car companies to the rear view mirror position. So it has a full view of the entire cabin of the car. And you can detect how many people are in the car. What are they doing so we do activity detection? Like eating or drinking or in some regions of the world smoking, we can detect if a baby's in the car seat, right. And if, unfortunately, in some cases, they're forgotten. So parents just leave the car and forget the kid in the car. That's an easy computer vision problem to solve, right? can detect there's a car seat, there's a baby can text the parent, and hopefully, again, save lives. So. So that was the impetus for the acquisition. It's been a year.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"So that I mean, there's a lot of a lot of questions, really exciting space, especially to me, I just find this a fascinating problem, it can enrich the experience in the car in so many ways, especially because like, we spent Still, despite COVID, I mean, COVID changed things. So it's in interesting ways. But I think the world is bouncing back. And we spent so much time in the car and the car is such a weird little world, we'll have ourselves that people do all kinds of different stuff, like, listen to podcasts, they, they think about stuff, they they get angry, they get, they do phone calls, there's like a little world of its own with a kind of privacy, that for many people that don't get anywhere else. It's and it's a little box, it's like a psychology experiment, because it feels like the angriest. Many humans in this world get is inside the car. It's so interesting. So it's such an opportunity to explore how we can enrich how companies can enrich that experience. And also, as the cars get become more and more automated, there's more and more opportunity, the variety of activities that you can do in the car increases is super interesting. So I mean, on a practical sense, smart AI has been selected, at least I read by 14 of the world's leading car manufacturers for 94 car models. So it's an a lot of cars. How hard is it to work with car companies. So they're all different? They all have different needs, the ones I've gotten a chance to interact with a very focused on cost. So it's anyone who's focused on cost, it's like, do you hate fun? Let's just have some fun. Let's figure out the most fun thing we can do in the worry about cars later. But I think because the way the car industry works, I mean, it's it's a very thin margin that you get to operate under. So you have to really, really make sure that everything you add to the car makes sense financially. So anyways, there is this this new industry, especially at this scale of smart AI, does it hold any lessons for you? Yeah,","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"I think it is a very tough market to penetrate. But once you're in, it's awesome, because once you're in, you're designed into these car models for like somewhere between five to seven years, which is awesome. And you just once they're on the road, you just get paid a royalty fee per vehicle. So it's a high barrier to entry. But once you're in, it's amazing. I think the thing that I struggle the most with in this industry is the time to market. So often we're asked to lock or do have code freeze two years before the car is going to be on the road. I'm like guys that you understand the pace with which technology moves. So I think car companies are really trying to make the Tesla, the Tesla transition to become more of a software driven architecture. And that's hard for many, it's just the cultural change. I mean, I'm sure you've experienced that.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"But I think one of the biggest inventions or imperatives created by Tesla is like to me personally, okay, people are going to complain about this. But I know electric vehicle I know, autopilot AI stuff. To me, the software or their software updates is like the biggest revolution in cars. And it is extremely difficult to switch to that because it is a culture shift it at first, especially if you're not comfortable with it. It seems dangerous. Like there's a there's an approach to cars is so safety focused for so many decades, that like what do you mean we dynamically change code? The whole point is you have a thing that you test, like, right here. And like it's not reliable, because you know how much you cause you have to recall this cars, right? There's a there's a and there's an understandable obsession with safety. But the downside of an obsession with safety is the same as with being obsessed with safety as a parent is like if you do that too much you limit the potential development in the field. Wirsching have in that particular aspect human being but in this particular aspect of the software, the artificial neural network of it. And but it's it's tough to do, it's really tough to do culturally and technically, like the deployment, the mass deployment of software is really, really difficult. But I hope that's where the industry is doing. One of the reasons I really want Tesla to succeed is exactly about that point, not autopilot. Not the electrical vehicle, but the software zation. Yeah, of basically everything but cars, especially, because to me, that's actually going to increase two things increased safety. Yeah, because you can update much faster, but also increased the effectiveness of folks like you who dream about enriching the human experience with AI, because you can just like just like, there's a feature that you want, like a new emoji or whatever, like the way Tik Tok releases, filters, you can just release that are in car, in car stuff. So, but yeah, that that's definitely","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"one of the use cases we're looking into is once you know, the sentiment of the passengers of the vehicle, you can optimize the temperature in the car, you can change the lighting, right? So if the backseat passengers are falling asleep, you can dim the lights, you can lower the music, right, you can do all sorts of things.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah. I mean, of course, you could do that kind of stuff with a two year delay, but it's tougher. Yeah. Do you think do you think Tesla or Wei Mo, or some of these companies that are doing semi or fully autonomous driving should be doing driver sensing? Yes. Are you thinking about that kind of stuff. So not just how we can enhance in cab experience for cars that are melee driven, but the ones that are increasingly more autonomously driven?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Yes. So if we fast forward to the universe, where it's fully autonomous, I think interior sensing becomes extremely important because the role of the driver isn't just to drive, think about the driver almost manages, manages the dynamics within a vehicle. And so who's going to play that role? When it's an autonomous car, we want a solution that is able to say, Oh, my God, like, you know, Lex is bored to death. Because the cars moving way too slow. Let's engage Lex or Ron is freaking out because she doesn't trust this vehicle yet. So let's tell Ron, I like a little bit more information about the route or right so I think, or somebody's having a heart attack in the car, like you need interior sensing and fully autonomous vehicles. But with semi autonomous vehicles, I think it's, I think it's really key to have driver monitoring, because semi autonomous means that sometimes the car is in charge. Sometimes the driver is in charge or the copilot right? And you need this, you need both systems to be on the same page, you need to know the car needs to know if the drivers asleep before it transitions control over to the driver. And sometimes, if the driver is too tired, the car can say, I'm going to be a better driver than you are right now. I'm taking control over so this dynamic this dance is so key and you can't do that without driver sensing. Yeah, there's a","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"disagreement for longest time I've had to deal on that this is obvious that this should be in the Tesla from day one. And it's obvious the driver sensing is not a hinderance it's not obvious. I should be careful because having studied this problem, nothing is really obvious. But it seems very likely a driver sensing is not a hindrance to an experience. It's only an enriching to the experience. And likely increases the safety that said, It is very surprising to me, just having studied semi autonomous driving how well humans are able to manage that dance, it was the intuition before you were doing that kind of thing, then humans will become just incredibly distracted, they would just like let the thing do its thing. But they're able to you know, because it is life and death, right and they're able to manage that somehow. But that said, there's no reason not to have driver sensing on top of that, I feel like that's going to allow you to do that dance that you're currently doing without driver sensing except touching the steering wheel. To do that even better, I mean, the possibilities are endless. And the machine learning possibilities are endless such a it's such a beautiful it's also constrained environment so you could do a much more effectively than you can with the external environment. Right so environment is full of weird edge cases and complexities inside there's so much it's so fascinating. Such a fascinating world they I do hope that companies like Tesla and others even even WeMo which I don't even know if Wei Mo is doing anything sophisticated inside the cab. I don't think so. Like what what what is it? I honestly think I honestly think it goes back to the robotics thing we were talking about, which is like great engineers that are building this a AI systems just are afraid to the human being","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"

Rana el Kaliouby,"You know, one of the coolest work we did in collaboration with MIT around this was we looked at longitudinal data, right of drive, because because, you know, MIT had access to like, tons of data. And, and like, just seeing the patterns of people like driving in the morning versus off to work versus like commuting back from work or weekend driving versus weekday driving? And is, wouldn't it be so cool if your car knew that and then was able to optimize either the route or the experience or even make recommendations? I think it's very powerful.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"

Of course, you have to get the privacy, right, you get all that kind of stuff, right? But I wish I asked the, you know, people are paranoid about this. But I would like a smart refrigerator. We have a such a deep connection with food as a human civilization. I would like to have a refrigerator that would understand me that, you know, I also have a complex relationship with food because I, you know, pick out too easily and all that kind of stuff.

We use a lot of us a lot of people that commute use the car every single day, a lot of us use a refrigerator every single day, the microwave, like we just saw, like, I feel like certain things could be made more efficient, more enriching, and AI is there to help like some just basic recognition of you as a human being, but your patterns what makes you happy, not happy and all that kind of stuff in the car, obviously.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"

I think technologically though, and even the technology, I can see a path to making it happen. I think it's the use case the how does the car respond? Once it knows something about you, because you want it to respond in a thoughtful way that doesn't, that isn't off putting to the consumer and the car. So I think that's like the user experience. I don't think we've really nailed that. And we usually, that's not weird the sensing platform, but we usually collaborate with the car manufacturer to decide what the use cases.

Or maybe it takes more aggressive behaviors and basically said, Okay, if you don't like take arrests in the next five minutes, the car's gonna shut down, right? Like, there's a whole range of actions the car can take, and doing the thing that is most, yeah, that builds trust with the driver and the passengers.

And that's the thing, that's the family brand or something like that. Or Ford or GM, whatever, they stick to that thing. Yeah, it's interesting. So it should be I don't know, it should be a little more about the technology inside. And I suppose there are two there could be branding, like a very specific style of luxury or fight. Right, all that kind of stuff. Yeah.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"You know, I'm, I have a I have an AI focused fund to invest in early stage kind of AI driven companies and one of the companies we're looking at is trying to do what Tesla did but for boats for recreational votes. Yeah, they're so they're building an electric and kind of slash autonomous boat, it's kind of the same issues like what kind of sensors can you put in? What kind of states can you detect both exterior and interior within the boat? Anyways, that's like really interesting. Do you vote at all?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"No, not well, not in that way. I do like to get on the lake or a river and fish from okay. But that's not boding that's a different that's, that's still floating low tech low tech get away from get closer to nature but I guess going out to the ocean is also is also getting closer to nature. It's a deep sense. I mean, I guess that's why people love it. Yeah. The the enormity of the water just underneath you Yeah. I love the I love both I love saltwater was like the big and just It's humbling to be in front of this giant thing. That's so powerful that was here before us and be here after but also have the piece of a small like, wooded like it's just it's everything's common. Therapeutic. You tweeted that I'm excited about Amazon's acquisition of iRobot I think it's a super interesting just given the trajectory of what you're part of, of these. Honestly small number of companies that are playing in this space that are like trying into have an impact on human being. So the it is an interesting moment in time that Amazon would acquire iRobot. He tweet I imagine a future where home robots are as ubiquitous as microwaves or toasters. Here are three reasons why I think this is exciting. If you remember, I can look it up. But what, why is this exciting to you?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"I mean, I think the first reason why this is exciting to kind of remember the exact like, order in which I put them, but one is just, it's, it's going to be an incredible platform for understanding our behaviors within the home. Right? Like, you know, if you think about Roomba, which is, you know, the robot vacuum cleaner, the flagship product of iRobot, at the moment, it's like running around your home, understanding the layout is understanding what's clean, and what's not, how often do you clean your house. And all of these like behaviors are a piece of the puzzle in terms of understanding who you are as a consumer. And I think that could be, again, used in really meaningful ways not just to recommend better products or whatever, but actually, to improve your experience as a human being. So I think I think that's very interesting. I think the natural evolution of these robots in the in the home, so it's interesting, Roomba isn't really a social robot, right at the moment. But I once interviewed one of the chief engineers on the Roomba team, and he talked about how people named their Roombas. And if the Roomba broke down, they would call in and say, you know, my Roomba broke down. And the company would say, well, we'll just send you a new one and No, no, Rosie, like, you have to like, yeah, I want you to fix this particular robot. So people have already built like, interesting emotional connections with these home robots. And I think that, again, that provides a platform for really interesting things to to just motivate change, like it could help you. I mean, one of the companies just spun out of MIT, Kataria health. The guy who started it spent a lot of time building robots that help with weight management. So weight management, sleep eating better. Yeah, all of these things.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"With if I'm being honest, Amazon does not exactly have a track record of winning over people in terms of trust. Now, that said, it's a really difficult problem for human beings to let a robot in their home that has a camera on it, right? That's really really, really tough. And I think Roomba actually had to think about this, but I'm pretty sure now or for some time already has had cameras because they're doing the most recent robot has so many robots. Oh, you actually do? Why program that I don't use a Roomba for backoff people have been to my place. They're like, yeah, you definitely don't use these robots. Good, because","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"I can't tell like the valence of this comment. That was a compliment. Or like, no,","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"it's a giant it's just a bunch of electronics everywhere. There's of six or seven computers of robots everywhere legged robots, as small robots and big robots and it's just giant just piles of robots stuff. And yeah. But including the room was there they're being used for their body and intelligence without for their purpose. I had I've changed them, repurpose them for other purposes. For deeper, more meaningful purposes than just like the bought a robot. Yeah. Which is, you know, brings a lot of people happiness, I'm sure they have a camera because the thing they advertised I had my own cameras, so but the camera and the new Roomba. They have like state of the art poop detection as they advertised, which is a very difficult apparently is a big problem for vacuum cleaners is you know, if they go over like dog poop, it just runs it runs it over and creates a giant mess. So they have like, apparently, they collected like a huge amount of data in different shapes and looks and whatever of poop, and now they're able to avoid it. And so they're very proud of this. So there is a camera, but you don't think of it as having a camera? Yeah, you don't think of it as having a camera because you've grown to trust that I guess because our phones, at least most of us seem to trust. Right? This phone even though there's a camera looking directly at you. I think that if you trust that the company is taking security very seriously, I actually don't know how that trust was earned with smartphones. I think it just started provide a lot of positive value to your life. We just took it in. And then the company over time has shown that it takes privacy very seriously. That kind of stuff, but I just Amazon is not always in the inner social robots. communicated this as a trustworthy thing, both in terms of culture and competence. They think privacy is not just about what do you intend to do, but also how well how good are you at doing that kind of thing? So that's a really hard problem to solve.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"But I mean, but a lot of us have Alexa at home. And I mean, Alexa could be listening in the whole time, right? And doing all sorts of nefarious things to data. Yeah, hopefully it's not, but I don't think it is.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"But you know, Amazon is not it's such a tricky thing for a company to get right. Which is like to earn the trust. I don't think Alexa are in people's trust quite yet.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Yeah, I think it's, it's not there quite yet.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"I struggle with this kind of stuff. In fact, when these topics are brought up, people are always get like nervous. And I think if you get nervous about it, that means that like, the way to earn people's trust is not by like, ooh, don't talk about this. It's just be open, be frank, be transparent. And also create a culture of like, where it radiates at every level, from engineer to CEO that like, you're good people that have common sense idea of what it means to respect basic human rights and the privacy of people and all that kind of stuff. And that I think that propagates throughout the that's the best PR, which is like, over time, you understand that this? These are good, right? Good folks doing good things. Anyway, speaking of social robots, have you heard about Tesla Tesla bought the humanoid robot? Yes, I","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"have. Yes, yes. I don't exactly know what it's designed to do. You probably do.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"No, I know it's designed to do but I have a different perspective on it. But it's designed to a humanoid form. And it's designed to, for automation tasks in the same way that industrial robot arms automate tasks in the factory so as to automate tasks in the factory. But I think that humanoid form, as we were talking about before, is, is one that we connect with as human beings, anything anything legged, mostly, but the humanoid form, especially, we anthropomorphize it most intensely. And so the possibility to me it's exciting to see both Atlas developed by Boston Dynamics, and anyone, including Tesla, trying to make humanoid robots cheaper, and more effective. The obvious way it transforms the world is social robotics to me, versus, versus automation of tasks in the factory. So yeah, I just wanted a case that was something you're interested in, because I find it I find its application social robotics. super interesting.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"

And you know, retail stores, mostly customer service, right? hotel lobbies. And, I mean, I don't know where the state of the robot is. But I think it's very promising. I think there are a lot of applications where this can be helpful. I'm also really interested in Yeah, social robotics for the home, right? Like the can help elderly people, for example, transport things from one location of the home to the other, or even like, just have your back in case something happens. Yeah, I don't know. I do think it's a very interesting space. It seems early, though. Do you feel like the timing is now?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"i Yes. 100%. So it always seems early until it's not right. Right. Right. All right. I think the time. I definitely think that the time is now like this decade for social robots. Whether the humanoid form is right, I don't think so. I don't I think like, if we just look judo, at Judo as an example. I feel like most of the problem, the challenge the opportunity of social connection between an AI system and the human being does not require you to also solve the problem of robot manipulation and mobility, bipedal mobility. So I think you could do that with just a screen honestly. But there's something about the interface of GE, who can rotate and so on, that's also compelling. But you get to see all these robot companies that are failed that fail incredible companies like GE bone. Even. I mean, the iRobot, in some sense is a big success story that it was able to find a nice niche thing and focus on it. But in some sense, it's not a success story, because they didn't build any other robot like any other. It didn't expand. It's all kinds of robotics that can once you're in the home, maybe that's what happens with Amazon is they'll flourish into all kinds of other robots. But do you have a sense, by the way, why it's so difficult to build a robotics company? Like why so many companies have failed?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"I think it's like, you're building a vertical stack, right? Like you are building the hardware plus the software and you find you have to do this at a cost. That makes sense. So I think G Bo, was retailing at like, I don't know, like $800, like $700. Which for the use case, right? There's a dissonance there. It's too high. So I think costs is the is, you know, the cost of building the whole platform in a way that that is, yeah, that that is affordable, for what value it's bringing, I think that's the challenge. I think for these home robots that are going to help, you know, help you do stuff around the home. That's a challenge to like the mobility piece of it. That's, that's, that's hard. Well,","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"one of the things I'm really excited with Tesla bot is the people working on it. And that's probably the criticism, I will reply to some of the other folks who worked on social robots is the people working on Tesla bought, know how to they're focused on and know how to do mass manufacture, I'll create a product that's super cheap, very cool. That focus the engineering focus isn't, I would say, you can also criticize him for that is they're not focused on the experience of the robot. They're focused on how to get this thing to do the basic stuff that the humanoid form requires to do it as cheap as possible, then the fewest number of actuators, the furious numbers of motors, the increase efficiency, decrease the weight, all that kind of stuff. So that's, that's really, I would say that g bone, all those folks, they focus on the design, the experience all of that, and it's secondary, how to manufacture. No, you have to think, like the Tesla bought folks from first principles. What is the fewest number of components, the cheapest components? How can I build it as much in house as possible without, without having to consider all the complexities of a supply chain? All that kind of stuff? Interesting. Because if you have to build a robotics company, you have to, you're not building one robot, you're building, hopefully, millions of robots, they have to figure out how to do that. Where the final thing? I mean, if it's GMO type of robot, is there a reason why GMO? Like we're gonna have this lengthy discussion? Is there a reason why GMO has to be over $100? It shouldn't be? Right, like the basic eight, right? The basic components of it, right? Like, you could start to actually discuss like, Okay, what is this extra thing about GMO? How much what is the cheapest way, I can have a screen, what's the cheapest work and have a rotating base, all that kind of stuff. And then you get get down? Continuously drive down costs.

Like, yes, you're thinking about this, like humongous, like super elegant, super beautiful thing, what the gods reduce it to the littlest thing we can bring to market that can solve a problem or that can I, you know, that can help address a pain point that somebody has, they often tell you, like, start with a customer of one, right?

Right?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"I also think, like who you bring around the table early on is so key, right? Like being clear on on what They call like your core values are your North Star. It might sound fluffy, but actually, it's not so, and Roz, and I feel like we did that very early on, we sat around her kitchen table, and we said, okay, there's so many applications of this technology, how are we going to draw the line? How are we going to set boundaries, we came up with a set of core values, that in the hardest of times, we fell back on to determine how we make decisions. And so I feel like just getting clarity on these core like, for us, it was respecting people's privacy, only engaging with industries where it's clear opt in. So for instance, we don't do any work in security and surveillance. So things like that just getting we are very big on, you know, one of our core values is human connection and empathy. Right? And that is, yes, it's an AI company, but it's about people. Well, these are all they become encoded in how we act, even even if you're a small, tiny team of two or three or whatever.

Yeah, right. Even even not just startup like even everyday people's lives right there. You always like, have run into obstacles, and you run into naysayers. And if you need people who are believers, whether they're people on your team, or even your investors, you need investors who are really believers in what you're doing.

And I love the stage, there's a lot of uncertainty there. So some investors really don't like the stage, because the financial models aren't there. Often, the teams aren't even like formed really, really early. But to me, it's, it's like a magical state, because it's the time when there's so much conviction, so much belief, almost delusional, right.

And that was not clearly Pictured is mostly in the emotional world. I mean, I think about that, from robotics. You know, I have this desire, I've had my whole life to walk, took different shapes. But I think once I discovered AI, the desire was to I think, in this in the context of this conversation could be easily easier described as basically a social robotics company. And that's something I dreamed of doing. And there's a lot there's a lot of complexity to that story. But that's that's the that's the only thing honestly, I dream of doing. So I imagined a world that that I could help create, but it's not. There's no steps along the way. And I think I'm just kind of stumbling around and falling happiness and working my ass off in almost rent like an ant does in random directions. But a lot of people a lot of successful people around me say this you should have a plan should have a clear goal. You have a goal at the end of the month, you have got the end of the year. I don't I don't don't and there's a balance to be struck of course, but there's something to be said about really making sure that you're living life to the fullest that goals can actually get in the way of","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,so one of the best like kind of most what do you what do you call it when as like Chow challenges your brain what do you call it?,"Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"The only thing that comes to mind and this is me saying is a mindfuck but yeah Okay,","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"something like that. Yes, super inspiring talk, Kenneth Stanley, he was at open AI, he just laughed. And he has a book called Why greatness cannot be planned. And it's actually an AI book. So and he's done all these experiments that basically show that when you over optimize you, like the trade off is you're less creative, right? And to create true greatness and truly creative solutions to problems. You can't over planets, you can't. And I thought that was and so he generalizes it beyond AI. And he talks about how we apply that in our personal life. And in our organizations that are companies which are over KPIs, right, like, look at any company in the world, and it's all like, these are the goals, these are the, you know, weekly goals, you know, the Sprint's and then the quarterly goals, blah, blah, blah, and he just shows with a lot of his AI experiments, that that's not how you create truly game changing ideas. So there you go.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, yeah.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"He's awesome. Yeah, there's,","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"there's a balance, of course, that's yeah, many moments of genius will not come from planning and goals. But you still have to build factories, and you still have to manufacturing, you still have to deliver in there still deadlines and all that kind of stuff. And that, for that it's good to have goals.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"I do goal setting with my kids, we all have our goals. But but but I think we're starting to morph into more of these, like bigger picture goals and not obsess about like, I don't know, it's hard.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"Well, I honestly think, especially with kids, it's better, much, much better to have a plan and have goals and so on. Because you have to, you have to learn the muscle of like, what it feels like to get stuff done. Yeah. But I think once you learn that there's flexibility for me, because I spent most of my life with goal setting, and so on. So like, sure I've gotten good grades in school, I mean, school, if you want to be successful school, you have, I mean, the kind of stuff in high school and college that kids have to do, in terms of managing their time getting so much stuff done. It's like, you know, taking 567 classes in college, they're like that would break the spirit of most humans, if they took one of them later in life, that's a really difficult stuff, especially engineering curricula. So I think you have to learn that skill. But once you learn it, you can maybe because you're you can be a little bit of on autopilot and use that momentum. And then allow yourself to be lost in the flow of life, you know, just kind of also give like, I worked pretty hard to allow myself to have the freedom to do that. That's really, right. That's a tricky freedom to have. Yeah. Because like a lot of people get lost in the rat race. And they right. And they also, like, financially, they, whenever you get a raise, they'll get like a bigger house. Right? Right. Right. So this I put for so like, if there's, you're always trapped in this race, I put a lot of emphasis on living like below my means always. So there's a lot of freedom to do whatever. Whatever the heart desires that yeah, that's a really, but everyone has to decide what's the right thing? What's the right thing for them, for some people having a lot of responsibilities, like a house, they can barely afford, or having a lot of kids, the responsibility side of that is really helps them get their shit together. Like, alright, I need to be really focused on some of the most successful people I know, have kids and the kids bring out the best in them and make them more productive and less productive accountability. Yeah, accountability thing, and almost something to actually live and fight and work for, like having a family. Yeah. It's It's fascinating to see, because you would think kids would be a hit on productivity, but they're not. For a lot of really successful people. They really like they're like an engine of right efficiency. Oh, my God. Yeah. Yeah. It's weird. Yeah. I mean, it's beautiful. It's beautiful to see and also source of happiness. Speaking of which, what role do you think love plays in the human condition? Love?","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,I think love is is. I think I think it's why we're all here. I think it would be very hard to live life without love in any of its forms. Right.,"Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, that's the most beautiful forms. It's that human connection takes right. Yeah, I feel like","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"everybody wants to feel loved. Right. And one way or another right and to love Yeah, love to totally. Yeah, I agree with that. Both","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"of it. I'm gonna Yeah, sure what feels better. Both both like,","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,to give love to. Yeah.,"Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"And it is like we've been talking about an interesting question where there's some of that whether One day we'll be able to love a toaster. Some small, I wasn't quite thinking about that when I toasted love Okay. Brad Pitt? Alright, well, I think we, we started on love and love. This was an incredible conversation, Ron, and thank you so much. You're an incredible person, thank you for everything you're doing in AI in the space of just caring about humanity, human emotion about love and being an inspiration to a huge number of people in robotics and AI in science in the world of general. So thank you for talking to me. It's an honor.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Rana el Kaliouby,"Thank you for having me. And you know, I'm a big fan of yours as well. So it's been a pleasure.","Rana el Kaliouby - Emotion AI, Social Robots, and Self-Driving Cars.txt"
Lex Fridman,"Thanks for listening to this conversation with Ronda alkyl UB. To support this podcast. Please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, let me leave you with some words from Helen Keller. The best the most beautiful things in the world cannot be seen or even touched. They must be felt with the heart.
