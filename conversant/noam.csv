Noam Brown,"A lot of people were saying like, Oh, this whole idea of game theory, it's just nonsense. And if you really want to make money you got to like look into the other person's eyes and read their soul and figure out what cards they have. But what happened was where we played our bot against four top heads up no limit Hold'em poker players, and the bot wasn't trying to adapt to them. It wasn't trying to exploit them. It wasn't trying to do these mind games, it was just trying to approximate the Nash equilibrium, and it crushed them.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"The following is a conversation with Noah Brown, research scientist at fair Facebook AI research group at meta AI. He co created the first AI system that achieved superhuman level performance. In No Limit Texas Hold'em both heads up and multiplayer. And now recently, he co created an AI system that can strategically out negotiate humans using natural language in a popular board game called diplomacy, which is a war game that emphasizes negotiation. This is the LEX Friedman podcast to support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Noam Brown. You've been a lead on three amazing AI projects. So we got libres that solved or at least achieved human level performance on No Limit Texas Hold'em poker with two players heads up. You got Pluribus that solved No Limit Texas Hold'em poker with six players. And just now you have Cicero these are all names of systems that solved or achieved human level performance on the game of diplomacy, which for people who don't know, is a popular strategy board game. It was loved by JFK, John F. Kennedy and Henry Kissinger and many other big famous people in the decades since so let's talk about poker and diplomacy today. First poker what is the game of No Limit Texas Hold'em? And How's it different from chess?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Well, No Limit Texas Hold'em poker is the most popular variant of poker in the world. So you know you go to a casino you play sit down at the poker table, the game that you're playing is No Limit Texas Hold'em. If you watch movies about poker, like Casino Royale, or Rounders, the game that they're playing is No Limit Texas Hold'em poker. Now it's very different from limit Hold'em. And you can bet any amount of chips that you want. And so the stakes escalate really quickly, you start out with like one or $2 in the pot. And then by the end of the hand, you've got like $1,000 in there, maybe",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"two, the option to increase the number very aggressively, very quickly is always there,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"right? The no limit aspect is there's no limit to how much you can bet. You know, you can limit Hold'em, there's like $2 in the pot, you can only bet like $2. But if you got $10,000 in front of you, you're always welcome to put $10,000 into the pot.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So I've had a chance to hang out with Phil Hellmuth, who plays all these different variants of poker. And correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like no limit rewards crazy. versus the other ones rewards more kind of calculated strategy, or no, because you're sort of looking from an from an analytic perspective is is strategy also rewarded. In No Limit Texas Hold'em.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I think both variants reward strategy. But I think what's different about no limit Hold'em is it's it's much easier to get jumpy, you know, you go in there thinking you're going to lose, you're going to play for like $100 or something. And suddenly, there's like, you know, $1,000 in the pot, a lot of people can't handle that. Can you define jumping, when you're playing poker, you always want to choose the action that's going to maximize your expected value. It's kind of like kind of like with investing, right? Like, if you're ever in a situation where you're, the amount of money that's at stake is is going to have a material impact on your life, then you're going to play in a more risk averse style. You know, if somebody makes a huge bet, you're going to if you're playing No Limit Hold'em, and somebody makes a huge bet, there might come a point where you're like, This is too much money for me to handle like I can't risk this amount. And that's what throws a lot of people off. So that's the big difference, I think, between no limit and limit.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"What about on the action side when you're actually making that big bet? That's what I mean by crazy. I was trying to refer to the technical, the technical term of crazy meaning, use the big jump in the bet to completely throw off the other person in terms of their ability to reason optimally.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I think that's right. I think one of the key strategies in poker is to put the other person into an uncomfortable position. And if you're doing that, then you're you're playing poker well, and there's a lot of opportunities to do that. And no limit Hold'em. You know, you can have like $50 in there, you throw in $1,000 bet. And you know that sometimes if you do it right, it puts the other person in a really tough spot. Now, it's also possible that you make huge mistakes that way. And so it's really easy to lose a lot of money and no limit Hold'em. If you don't know what you're doing Mmm. But there's a lot of upside potential to",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"so when you build systems AI systems that play these games, we'll talk about poker, we'll talk about diplomacy. Are you? Are you drawn in, in part by the beauty of the game itself AI aside, or is it to you primarily a fascinating problem set for the AI to solve?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I'm joined by the beauty of the game when I, I started playing poker when I was in high school. And the idea to me that there is a correct and objectively correct way of playing poker. And if you could figure out what that is, then you're, you know, you're making unlimited money, basically. That's like a really fascinating concept to me. And so I was fascinated by the strategy of poker, even when I was like, 16 years old. It wasn't until much later that I actually worked on poker API's.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So there was a sense that you can solve poker, like, in a way you can solve chess, for example, checkers. I believe checkers got solved, right? You think",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"checkers, checkers is completely solved optimal, optimal strategy, it's impossible to beat the AI.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah. And so in that same way, you could technically solve chess,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"you could solve chess, you could solve poker, you could solve poker. So this is this gets into the concept of a Nash equilibrium. So it",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,is a Nash equilibrium. Okay. So,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"in any finite two player zero sum game, there is an optimal strategy, that if you play it, you are guaranteed to not lose an expectation no matter what your opponent does. And this is kind of a radical concept to a lot of people. But it's true in chess, it's true in poker, it's true in any finite two player zero sum game. And to get some intuition for this, you can think of Rock Paper, scissors, and Rock Paper, Scissors. If you randomly choose between throwing rock, paper and scissors with equal probability, then no matter what your opponent does, you're not going to lose an expectation, you're not going to lose an expectation in the long run. Now, the same is true for poker, there exists some strategy, some really complicated strategy, that if you play that you are guaranteed to not lose money in the long run. And I should say, this is for two player poker six player poker is a different story.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, it's a beautiful, giant mess. When you say in expectation, you're guaranteed not to lose in expectation, what does an expectation mean?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"pokers a very high variance game. So you're going to have hands where you win, you're going to have hands with your lose, even if you're playing the perfect strategy, you can't guarantee they're gonna win every single hand. But if you play for long enough, then you're guaranteed to at least breakeven, and in practice, probably one.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So that's an expectation, the size of your stack, generally speaking. Now, that doesn't include anything about the fact that you can go broke, it doesn't include any of those kinds of normal real world limitations, you're talking in a in a theoretical world. What about the the zero sum aspect, how big of a constraint is that how big of a constraint is finite?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So finite, it's not a huge constraint. So I mean, most games that you play are finite in size. It's also true actually, that there exists this like perfect strategy in many infinite games as well, technically, the game has to be compact. There are like some edge cases where you don't have a Nash equilibrium in a two player zero sum game. So you can think of a game where you like, you know, for playing a game where whoever names, the bigger number is the winner, there's no Nash equilibrium to that game. 1718,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"but you'd be the one again, you're good at this, played a lot of games. Okay, so that's, and then the zero sum aspect, the 00 sum",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"aspects. So there exists a Nash equilibrium in non two player zero sum games as well. And by the way, just to clarify what I mean by two player zero sum, I mean, there's two players, and whatever one player wins, the other player loses. So if you're playing poker, and I went $50, that means that you're losing $50. Now, outside of two player zero sum games, there still exist Nash equilibria. But they're not as meaningful. Because you know, you can think of a game like risk. If everybody else at the on the board decides to team up against you and take you out. There's no perfect strategy you can play that's going to guarantee that you win, there is nothing you can do. So outside of two player zero sum games, there's no guarantee that you're going to win by playing a Nash equilibrium.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Have you ever tried to model in the other aspects of the game, which is like the pleasure you draw from playing the game. And then if you're a professional poker player, if you're exciting, even if you lose, the, you know, the money you would get from the attention you get to the sponsor, and all that kind of stuff, is that that'd be a fun thing to model to model in areas that make it sort of super complex to include the human factor. And this is full complexity.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I think you bring up a couple of good points there. So I think a lot of professional poker players I mean, they get a huge amount of money not from the actually playing poker but from the sponsorships and having a personality that people want to tune in and watch that. That's a big, that's a big way to make a name for yourself in poker.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I just wonder from an AI perspective, if you create and we'll talk about this more, maybe it AI says Some that also talks trash and all that kind of stuff, that that becomes part of the function to maximize. So it's not just optimal poker play. Maybe sometimes you want to be chaotic, maybe sometimes you want to be suboptimal, you lose the chaos. And maybe sometimes you want to be overly aggressive. Because the audience loves that. Yeah, say,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I think I think what you're getting at here is that there's a difference between making an AI that wins a game and an AI. That's fun to play with. Yeah. Yeah. And fun,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"to watch. So those are all different things fun to play with, and fun to watch. Yeah, and I",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"think, you know, I've, I've heard talks from like game designers, and they say, like, you know, people that work on AI for actual recreational games that people play. And they say, yeah, there's a big difference between trying to make an AI that actually wins, and you look at a game like civilization. The way that the AIS play is not optimal for trying to win. They're, they're playing a different game. They're trying to have personalities, they're trying to be fun and engaging. And that makes for a better game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah. And we also talked about NPCs. I just talked to Todd Howard, who is the creator of Fallout and the Elder Scrolls series and Starfield, the new game coming out. And the Creator what I think is the greatest game of all time, which is Skyrim. And the NPCs. There, the AI that governs that whole game is very interesting, but the NPC is also super interesting. And considering what language models might do, to NPCs in an open world, RPG role playing game is super exciting.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, honestly, um, I think this is like one of the first applications where we're going to see like real consumer interaction with large language models. I guess like Elder Scrolls six is in development. Now. They're probably like, pretty close to finishing it. But I would not be surprised at all, if Elder Scrolls seven was using large language models for their NP.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"There. I mean, I'm not saying anything, saying anything. Me speculating, not you know what, but there's, they're just releasing the stuff feel good. They do one game at a time. Yeah. And so whatever it is, whenever the data is, I don't know what the date is calm down. But it would be I don't know, like 2024 2526. So it's actually very possible that would include language models.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I was listening to this, this talk by a gaming executive when I was in grad school. And one of the questions that the person in the audience asked is, why are all these games so focused on fighting and killing, and the person responded that it's just so much harder to make an AI that can talk with you and cooperate with you than it is to make an AI that can fight you. And I think once this technology develops further, and you can have, you can reach a point where like, not every single line of dialogue has to be scripted, it unlocks a lot of potential for new kinds of games, like much more like positive interactions that are not so focused on fighting, I'm really looking forward to that",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"might not be positive might be just drama. So you'll be in that like a Call of Duty game, instead of doing the shooting, you'll just be hanging out. And like arguing with an AI about like, like passive aggressive, and then you won't be able to sleep that night, you have to return continue the argument that you were emotionally hurt. I mean, yeah, I think that's actually an exciting world, whatever, whatever is the drama, the chaos, that we love, the push and pull of human connection, I think it's possible to do that in the video game world. And I think you could be messier and make more mistakes in the video game world, which is why it'd be a nice place. And also, it doesn't have a deep have as deep of a real psychological impact. Because inside video games, it's kind of understood that urine is not a real world. So whatever crazy stuff AI does, we have some flexibility to play. Just like with a game of diplomacy, it's a game. This is not real geopolitics, not real war, it's, it's a game. So you can you can have a little bit of fun. A little bit of chaos. Okay, back to how do we find the Nash equilibrium?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Alright, so there's different ways to find an equilibrium. So the way that we do it is with this process called self play. Basically, we have this algorithm that starts by playing totally randomly, and it learns how to play the game by playing against itself. So it will start playing the game totally randomly. And then, you know, if it's playing poker, it'll eventually like, get to the end of the end of the game and make $50. And then it will like review all the decisions that I've made along the way, and say, What would have happened if I had chosen this other action instead? You know, if I had raised here instead of called, what would the other player have done? And because it's playing against a copy of itself, it's able to do that counterfactual reasoning, so they can say, Okay, well, if I took this action, and the other person takes this action, and then I take this action, and eventually I make $150 instead of 50. And so it updates the regret value for that action. Regret is basically like how much does it regret having not played that action in the past? And when it encounters that same situation, again, it's going to pick actions that have higher regret with higher probability. Now, it'll just keep simulating the games this way, it'll keep, you know, accumulating regrets for different situations. And in the long run, if you pick actions that have high regret, with higher probability in the correct way, it's proven to converge to a Nash equilibrium.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Even for super complex games, even for imperfect information games,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"it's true for all games it's true for it's true for chess, it's true for poker, it's particularly useful for poker.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So this is the method of counterfactual regret minimization, this is counterfactual regret minimization that doesn't have to do with self play has to do with just any, if you follow this kind of process of play or not, you will be able to arrive at an optimal set of actions.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So this counterfactual, regret minimization is a kind of self play. It's a principle kind of self play, that's proven to converge to Nash equilibria. Even in imperfect information games. Now you can have other forms of self play, and people use other forms of self playing for perfect information games. Where you have more flexibility, the algorithm doesn't have to be as theoretically sound in order to converge to that classic games, because there's, it's a simpler setting. Sure. So",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I kind of in my brain, the word self play has mapped in neural networks, but we're speaking something bigger than just the one that works. It could be anything. If the self playing mechanism is just the mechanism of a system playing itself.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Exactly. Yeah. Self play is not tied specifically to neural nets. It's a kind of reinforcement learning, basically. Okay. And I would also say, this process of like, trying to reason oh, what would the value had been if I had taken this other action instead? This is very similar to how humans learn to play a game like poker, right? Like you probably played poker before and with your friends, you probably asked like, Oh, what do you have called me if I raise their you know, and that's, that's a person trying to do the same kind of like learning from a counterfactual that the AI is doing.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Okay. And if you do that, at scale, you're going to be able to learn an optimal policy. Yep.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now where the neural nets come in, I said, like, Okay, if it's in that situation again, then it will choose the action that has high regret. Now, the problem is that poker is such a huge game. You know, I think it No Limit Texas Hold'em. The version that we were playing has 10 to the 161 different decision points, which is more than the number of atoms in the universe squared.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"That's heads up. That's heads up. Yeah. 10 To the one six to one, you said,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, I mean, it depends on the number of chips that you have the stacks and everything, but like the version that we were playing was 10 to the 161,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,which I assume would be a somewhat simplified version anyway. Because the about there's some like step function you had for like bets.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Oh, no, no, that's, that's I'm saying, like, we played the full game, you can bet whatever amount you want. And maybe it was constrained in like, what it considered for bet sizes, but the, the person on the other side could bid whatever they wanted. Yeah,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I mean, 161 plus or minus 10, doesn't matter.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so the the way neural nets help out here is, you know, you don't have to run into the same exact situation, because that's never gonna happen. Again, the odds of you running into the same exact situation are pretty slim. But if you run into a similar situation, then you can generalize from other states that you've been in that kind of looked like that one. And you can say like, well, these other situations, I had high regret for this action. And so maybe I should play that action here as well,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"which is the more complex game, chess, or poker, or go or poker,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"do, you know? That is a controversial question. Okay, I'm gonna post like",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,somebody screaming on Reddit right now depends on which subreddit you're on Chester's poker.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I'm sure like David Silva is gonna get really angry at me. I'll say I'm gonna say poker actually. And I think for a couple reasons. They're not,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,here to defend themselves. So,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"first of all, you have the imperfect information aspects. And so it's that we can go into that, but like, once you introduce imperfect information, things get much more complicated.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So we should say, maybe you can describe what is seen to the players what is not seen in the game of Texas Hold'em.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah. So Texas Hold'em you get two cards facedown, that only you see. And so that's the hidden information of the game. The other players also all get two cards facedown that only they see. And so you have to kind of as you're playing reason about like, Okay, what did they think I have? What do they have? What do they think? I think they have that kind of stuff. And that's, that's kind of where bluffing comes into play. Right? Because the fact that you can bluff. The fact that you can bet with a bad hand and still win is because they don't know what your cards are. Right? And that's the that's the key difference between a perfect information game like poker, sorry, like Chess and Go, and imperfect information games like poker. This is",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"what trash talk looks like. The implies statement is the game I saw this much tougher. But yeah, so when you're playing, I'm just gonna do random questions here. So would when you're playing your opponent under imperfect information, is there some degree to which you're trying to estimate the range of hands that they have? For Is that not part of the algo? So what are the different approaches to the imperfect information game?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So the key thing to understand about why imperfect information makes things difficult is that you have to worry not just about which actions to play, but the probability that you're going to play those actions. So you think about Rock Paper, Scissors, for example, Rock Paper, Scissors is an imperfect information game. Right? Because you don't know what I'm about to throw.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I do. But yeah, usually not Yeah.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so you can't just say like, I'm just gonna throw a rock every single time because the other person is going to figure that out and notice a pattern, and then suddenly, you're gonna start losing. And so you don't just have to figure out like which action to play, you have to figure out the probability that you play it. And really importantly, the value of an action depends on the probability that you're going to play it. So if you're playing rock every single time, that value is really low. But if you're never playing rock, he played Rock Lake 1% of the time, and suddenly, the, the other person is probably gonna be throwing scissors. And when you throw a rock, the value of that action is gonna be really high. Now you think that's a poker, what that means is the value of bluffing for example, if you're the kind of person that never bluffs and you have this reputation as somebody that never bluffs, and suddenly you bluff, there's a really good chance that that Bluff is going to work, and you're going to make a lot of money. On the other hand, if you've got a reputation, like if they seen you play for a long time, and they see oh, you're the kind of person that's bluffing all the time, when you bluff, they're not going to buy it, and they're going to call you down, you're gonna lose a lot of money. And that, finding that balance of how often you should be bluffing is the key challenge of a game of poker. And you contrast that with a game like chess, it doesn't matter if you're opening with the Queens Gambit, 10% of the time, or 100% of time, the value, the expected value is the same. So So that's, that's why we need these algorithms that understand, not just we have to figure out what actions are good, but the probabilities, we need to get the exact probabilities. Correct. And that's actually when we created the bottler brought us the broadest means balanced, because the algorithm that we designed, was designed to find that right balance of how often it should play each action, the balance",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,of how often in the key sort of branching is the bluff or not the bluff. Is that a is that a good crude simplification of the major decision in poker?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"It's a good simplification. I think that's like the main tension. But it's, it's not just how often to bluff or not to bluff. It's like, How often should you bet in general, how often should you what, what kind of bet should you make? Should you bet big or should you bet small win with which was with which hands. And so this is where the idea of a range comes from. Because when you're bluffing with a particular hand in a particular spot, you don't want there to be a pattern for the other person to pick up on, you don't want them to figure out, oh, whenever this person is in this spot, they're always bluffing. And so you have to reason about, okay, would I also bet with a good hand in this spot? You want to be unpredictable? So you have to think about, what would I do if I had this different set of cards?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Is there explicit estimation of like a theory of mind that the other person has about you? Or is that just a emergent thing that happens?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"The way that the bots handle it that are really successful? They have an explicit theory of mine. So they're explicitly reasoning about what are? What's the common knowledge, belief? What is What do you think I have with you, I think you have, what do you think I think you have, it's explicitly reasoning about those",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"there are multiple use there. So maybe that's jumping at the six players, but is there a stickiness to the person? So it's an iterative game, you're playing the same person? There is there's a stickiness to that, right? You're gathering information as you play? It's not every, every, every hand is in your hand. Is there a continuation in terms of estimating what kind of player I'm facing here?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"That's a good question. So you could approach the game that way, the way that the bots do it, they don't and the way that humans approach it also expert human players, the way they approach it, is to basically assume that you know, my strategy. So I'm going to try to pick a strategy where even if I were to play it for 10,000 hands, and you could figure out exactly what it was, you still wouldn't be able to beat it. Basically, what that means is I'm trying to approximate the Nash equilibrium, I'm trying to be perfectly balanced, because if if I'm playing the Nash equilibrium, even if you know what my strategy is, like I said, I'm still unbeatable in expectation. So that's what that's what the bot aims for. And that's actually what a lot of expert poker players aim for as well to start by playing the Nash equilibrium. And then maybe if they spot weaknesses in the way you're playing, then they can deviate a little bit to take advantage of that.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"They aim to be unbeatable and expectation. Okay, so who is the greatest poker player of all time? And why is it Phil Hellmuth so this is fulfill. So he's known, at least in part For maybe playing sub optimally, and he still wins a lot. It's a bit chaotic. So maybe, can you speak from an AI perspective about the genius of his madness, or the madness of his genius. So playing sub optimally playing chaotically as a way to make you hard to pin down about what your strategy is.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So, okay, the thing that I should explain first of all was like Nash equilibrium, it doesn't mean that it's predictable. The whole point of it is that you're trying to be unpredictable. Now, I think why somebody like Phil Hellmuth might be really successful, is not in being unpredictable, but in being able to take advantage of the other player and figure out where they're being predictable, or guiding the other player into thinking that you have certain weaknesses. And then and then understanding how they're going to change their behavior. They're gonna deviate from a Nash equilibrium style of play, to try to take advantage of those perceived weaknesses, and then counter exploit them. So you kind of get into the mind games there.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So you think about these heads up poker as a dance between two agents, I guess, are you playing the cards? Are you playing the player?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So this this gets down to a big argument in the poker community and the academic community for a long time, there was this debate of like, what's called GTO game theory, optimal poker, or exploitative play. And up until about, like, 2017, when we did the librettist match, I think actually exploitative play had the advantage. A lot of people were saying, like, oh, this whole idea of game theory, it's just nonsense. And if you really want to make money, you got to like look into the other person's eyes and read their soul and figure out what cards they have. But what happened was people started adopting the game theory, optimal strategy. And they were making good money. And they weren't trying to adapt so much the other player, they were just trying to play the Nash equilibrium. And then what really solidified it, I think, was a little too broad as the librettist match, where we played our bot against four top heads up no limit Hold'em poker players, and the bot wasn't trying to adapt to them. It wasn't trying to exploit them. It wasn't trying to do these mind games, it was just trying to approximate the Nash equilibrium. And it crushed them. And think, you know, it we've replaying for $50 $100 blinds, and over the course of about 120,000 hands, it made close to $2 million and 120,000 Hands 120,000 Hands against humans. Yeah, and this was this was fake money to be clear. So there was real money at stake there was $200,000. First of all,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"all money is fake. But that's that's a different conversation. We give it meaning. It's an it's a it's a phenomena that gets meaning from our complex psychology as a human civilization. It's emerging from the collective intelligence of the human species. But that's not we mean, you mean like, there's literally you can't, you can't buy stuff with it. Okay. Can you actually step back and take me through that? Competition?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah. Okay. So when I was in grad school, there was this thing called the annual computer poker competition, where every year, all the different research labs that were working on AI for poker would get together they would make about they would play them against each other. And we made a bot that actually won the 2014 competition, the 2016 competition. And so we decided we're going to take this bot build on it, and play against real top professional heads up No Limit Texas Hold'em poker players. So we invited four of the world's best players in this specialty. And we challenged them to 120,000 Hands of poker over the course of 20 days. And we had $200,000 $200,000 in prize money at stake, where it would basically be divided among them, depending on how well they did relative to each other. So we wanted to have some incentive for them to play their best.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Did you have a confidence 2014 16 That this is even possible? How much doubt was there? So,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"we did a competition actually in 2015, where we also played against professional poker players and the bot lost by a pretty sizable margin, actually. Now there were some big improvements from 2015 to 2017. And so",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,can you speak to the improvements this is computational nature is the algorithm the methods it was,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"it was really an algorithmic approach. That was the difference. So 2015, it was much more focused on trying to come up with a strategy upfront, like trying to solve the entire game of poker, like and then just have a lookup table where you're saying, like, Oh, I'm in this situation, what's the strategy? The approach that we took in 2017 was much more search based. It was trying to say, Okay, well, let me in real time try to compute a much better strategy than what I had pre computed by playing against myself during self play. What",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"is the search space for poker? What are you searching over? What's that look like? There's different actions like raising, calling. Yeah. What are the actions? Is it just the social reactions",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"so In a game like chess, the search is like, Okay, I'm in this chess position. And I can, like, you know, move these different pieces and see where things end up. In poker, what you're searching over is the actions you can take for your hand, the probabilities that you take those actions, and then also the probabilities that you take other actions with other hands that you might have. And that's kind of like, hard to wrap your head around, like, why are you searching over these, like other hands that you might have, and like trying to figure out what you would do with those hands. And the idea is, again, you want to, you want to always be balanced and unpredictable. And so if your search algorithm is saying, like, oh, I want to raise with this hand, well, in order to know whether that's a good action, like let's say, it's a bluff, you know, let's say you have a bad hand, and you're saying, like, Oh, I think I should be betting here with this really bad hand and bluffing? Well, that that's only a good action, if you're also betting with a strong hand. Otherwise, it's an obvious bluff.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So if your action, in some sense, maximizes your unpredictability, so that action could be mapped by your opponent to a lot of different hands than that's a good action.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Basically, what you want to do is put your opponent into a tough spot. So you want them to always have some doubt, like, should I call here should I fold here? And if you are raising in the appropriate balance between bluffs and good hands, then you're putting them into that tough spot? And so that's what we're trying to do. We're always trying to search for a strategy that would put the opponent into a difficult position,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"can you give a metric that you're trying to maximize? or minimize? Does this have to do with the regret thing, or we're talking about in terms of putting your opponent in a maximally tough spot?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, ultimately, what you're trying to maximize is your expected winnings, like your expected value, the amount of money that you're going to walk away from assuming that your opponent was playing optimally in response. So you're going to assume that your opponent is is also playing, like, as well as possible a Nash equilibrium approach? Because if they're not, then you're just gonna make more money, right? Like, anything that deviates, like by definition, the Nash equilibrium is the strategy that does the best and expectation. And so if you're deviating from that, then you're just going to lose money. And since it's a two player zero sum game, that means you're going to make money. So there's",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"not an explicit like objective function that maximizes the toughness of the spot they're put in, you're always, this is from like a self play reinforcement learning perspective. You're just trying to maximize winnings? And the rest is implicit.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"That's right. Yeah. So we're what we're actually trying to maximize is the expected value given that the opponent is playing optimally in response to us. Now in practice, what that ends up looking like is, it's putting the opponent into difficult situations where there's no obvious decision to be made for the",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"system doesn't know anything about the difficulty of the situation. Not at all doesn't care. Yeah. All right, in my head was getting excited whenever I was making the other the opponent sweat. Okay, so your 2015, you didn't do as well. So what's the journey from that to a system that in your mind could have a chance?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So 2015, we we got we BRB, pretty badly. And we actually learned a lot from that competition. And in particular, you know, what became clear to me is that the way that humans were approaching the game was very different from how the bot was approaching the game, the bot would not be doing search, he would just be trying to compute, it would do like months of self play, it would just be playing against itself for months. But then when it's actually playing the game, he would just act instantly. And the humans, when they're in a tough spot, they would sit there and think, for sometimes even like five minutes about whether they're going to call or fold a hand. And it became clear to me that that's, there's there's a good chance that that's what missing, this was missing from our bots. So I actually did some initial experiments to try to figure out how much of a difference this is actually make. And the difference was huge",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"as a signal to the human player. How long you took think,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I don't know, I'm not saying that there are any timing tells I was saying when the human, like the bot would always act instantly, it wouldn't try to come up with a better strategy in real time, over what it had precomputed during training, whereas the human like they have all this intuition about how to play, but they're also in real time, leveraging their ability to think just to search to plan and coming up with an even better strategy, and then what their intuition would say. So you're",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"saying that there's you're doing that's what you mean by you doing search? Also, you have you have a intuition and search on top of that looking for a better solution.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, that's, that's what I mean by search that instead of acting instantly, you know, a neural net usually gives you a response and like 100 milliseconds or something depends on the size of the of the net. But if you can leverage extra computational resources, you can possibly get a much better outcome. And we did some experiments in small scale versions of poker. And what we what we found was that if you do a little bit of search even just a little bit, it was the equivalent of making As your, you know, your pre computed strategy, like you can kind of think of it as your neural net 1000 times bigger, with just a little bit of search. And it just like blew away all of the research that we had been working on and trying to like, scale up this like pre computed solution. It was dwarfed by the benefit that we got from search.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Can you just linger on what you mean by search? Here, you're searching over a space of actions for your hand? And for other hands? How are you selecting the other hands to search over? So yeah, randomly,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"no, it's all the other hands that you could have. So when you're playing No Limit Texas Hold'em, you've got two facedown cards. And so that's 52 choose to 1326 different combinations. Now, that's actually a little bit lower, because there's facelift cards in the middle. And so you can eliminate those as well. But you're looking at like around 1000 different possible hands that you can have. And so when we're doing when the bots doing search, it's thinking explicitly, there are these 1000 different hands that I could have there are these 1000 different hands that you could have? Let me try to figure out what would be a better strategy than what I've pre computed for these hands and your hands?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Okay, so that search, how do you fuse that with what the neural net is telling you? Or what the train system is telling you?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, so you kind of like that where the train system comes in is, is the value. So there's, you only look so far ahead, you look like maybe, you know, one round ahead. So if you're on the flop, you're looking to the start of the turn. And at that point, you can use the pre computed solution to figure out what are what's the value here of like, of this strategy?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Is it of a single action, essentially, in that spot, you're getting a value? Or is it the value of the entire series of actions?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Well, it's kind of both, because you're trying to maximize the value for the hand that you have. But in the process, in order to maximize the value of the hand that you have. You have to figure out what would I be doing with all these other hands as well?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Okay, but are you in the search? Or was going to the end of the game?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,In libres? We did. So we only use search starting on the turn. And then we searched all the way to the end of the game,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"to turn the river? Can we take it? Yeah, there was a terminology,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"yeah, there's four rounds of poker. So there's the preflop, the flop, the turn and the river. And so we would start doing search halfway through the game. Now the first half of the game that was all pre computed, it would just act instantly. And then when it got to the halfway point, then it would always search to the end of the game. Now we later improved this, so we didn't have to search all the way to the end of the game, it would actually search, just a few moves ahead. But that that came later. And that drastically reduced the number, the amount of computational resources that we needed.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,"right? I'm trying to think like, I'm going to bet and then what are you going to do in response? You're going to raise me Are you going to call? And then if you raise What should I do? So it's reasoning about that whole process up until the end of the game? In the case of libres?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Is there's something like, the brightness was constantly erasing or something like that even noticed,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"there was there was something really interesting that we observed with libres. So humans, when they're playing poker, they usually size their bets relative to the size of the pot. So you know, if the pot has $100 in there, maybe you bet like $75, somewhere around somewhere between like 50 and $100. And with libres, we gave it the option to basically bet whatever it wanted, it was actually really easy for us to say like, Oh, if you want, you can bet like 10 times the pot, and we didn't think would actually do that. It was just like, why not give it the option. And then during the competition, it actually started doing this. And by the way, this is like a very last minute decision on our part to add this option. And so we did not read it, we did not think the bot would would do this. And I was actually kind of worried when it did start to do this, like, oh, is this a problem? Like humans don't do this, like, is it screwing up? But it would put the humans into really difficult spots when it would do that? Because, you know, you can imagine like you have the second best hand that's possible given the board. And you're thinking like, Oh, you're in a really great spot here. And suddenly the bot bets $20,000 into you know, $1,000 pot and and it's basically saying like, I have the best hand or I'm bluffing and you having the second best hand like now you got a really tough choice to make. And so the humans would sometimes think like five or 10 minutes about what Like, what do you do? Should should I call should I fold? And? And when I saw the humans like really struggling with that decision, like, that's when I realized like, oh, actually this is maybe a good thing to do after all.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,"right from the bots perspective, it's just, it's just doing the thing that's going to make it the most money. And the fact that it's putting the humans in a difficult spot, like that's just, you know, a side effect of that. And this was I think, the the one thing I mean, there were a few things that the humans walked away from, but this was the, the number one thing that humans walked away from the competition saying, like, we need to start doing this. And now these over bets, what are called over bets, have become really common in high level poker play.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

We've focused on the most popular variants, so heads up No Limit Texas Hold'em. And then we follow that up with with six player poker as well, where he managed to make about that beat expert human players.

It's a good, a good estimate for if you're making the right decision.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So what else can you say about the fundamental role of search in poker? And maybe if you can also relate it to chess and go in these games? What's the role of search to solving these games?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, I think a lot of people under this is true for the general public. And I think it's true for the AI community. A lot of people underestimate the importance of search for these kinds of gaming results. An example of this is TD Gammon that came out in 1992. This was the first real instance of a neural net being used in a game AI. So landmark achievement, it was actually the inspiration for Alpha zero. And it used search, it used to play search to figure out its next move. You got deep blue there, he was very heavily focused on search, looking many, many moves ahead farther than any human could. And that was key for why it won. And then even with something like AlphaGo, I mean, AlphaGo is commonly hailed as a landmark achievement for neural nets. And it is, but there's also this huge component of search Monte Carlo Tree Search to AlphaGo. That was key absolutely essential for the AI to be able to be top humans. I think a good example of this is you look at the latest versions of alpha of AlphaGo. Like it was called Alpha zero. And there's this metric called EA low rating where you can compare different humans you can compare bots to humans. Now, a top human player is around 3600 kilo, maybe a little bit higher now. Alpha zero the strongest version is around 5200 kilo by If you take out the search that's being done at test time, and by the way, what I mean by search is the planning ahead, the thinking of like, Oh, if I move my, if I placed this stone here, and then he does this, and then you look like five moves ahead, and you see like what the board state looks like. That's what I mean by search. If you take out the search, that's done during the game, the ELO rating drops to around 3000. So even today, what seven years after AlphaGo, if you take out the Monte Carlo Tree Search that's being done, at one playing against the human, the bots are not superhuman, nobody has made a raw neural net, that is superhuman and go,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"that's worth lingering on. That's, that's quite profound. So without search, that just means looking at the next move, and saying, This is the best move. So having a function that estimates accurately what the best move is,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"that's right, without search. Yeah, and all these bots, they have the what's called a policy network, where it will tell you this is what the neural net thinks is the next best move. And it's kind of like a the intuition that a human has, you know, the the human looks at the board and, and any go or chess master will be able to tell you like, oh, instantly, here's what I think the right move is. And the bot is able to do the same thing. But just like how a human Grandmaster can make a better decision. If they have more time to think when you add on this Monte Carlo Tree Search, the bot is able to make a better decision.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, I mean, of course, a human is doing something like search in their brain, but it's not. I hesitate to draw a hard line. But it's not like Monte Carlo Tree Search. It's more like sequential language model generation. So it's like a different it's a neural network is doing the searching and wonder what the human brain is doing in terms of searching. Because you're doing that like computation, humanist computing, they have intuition they've got they have a really strong ability to estimate, you know, amongst the top players of what is good and not position without calculating all the details. But they're still doing search in their head was a different kind of search. Have you ever thought about like, what is the difference between the human the search that the human is performing versus what computers are doing?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I have thought a lot about that. And I think it's a really important question. So the AI in alpha and alphas in AlphaGo, or any of these guys, they're all doing Monte Carlo Tree Search, which is a particular kind of search. And it's actually a symbolic tabular search, it uses the neural net to guided search, but it isn't actually like, full full on neural net. Now, that kind of search is very successful in these kinds of like perfect information board games, like chess, and go. But if you take it to a game like poker, for example, it doesn't work, it can't, it can't understand the concept of hidden information, it doesn't understand the balance that you have to strike between, like the amount that you're raising versus the amount that you're calling. And in every one of these games, you see a different kind of search. And the human brain is able to plan for all these different games in a very general way. Now, I think that's one thing that we're missing from Ai today. And I think it's a really important missing piece. The ability to plan and reason were generally across a wide variety of different settings,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

But you know, they'll give you it'll output an answer in like, 100 milliseconds. And if you tell it, like, Oh, you got five minutes to give me a decision, you know, feel free to take more time to make a better decision. It's not gonna know what to do with that. But a human, if you're playing a game like chess, they're gonna give you a very different answer, depending on if you say, Oh, you got 100 milliseconds, or you've got five minutes.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,"Yeah, they got this thing called chain of thought reasoning. And that's, I think, super promising, right? Yeah, I think and I think it's a good step in the right direction. I would kind of like, say it's similar to Monte Carlo rollouts in in a game like chess, there's a kind of search that you can do, where you're saying, like, I'm going to roll out my intuition and see like, without really thinking, you know, what are the better decisions I can make farther down the path? What would I do if I just acted according to intuition for the next 10 moves?

And that kind of gives us some sense of like, are we making progress? Are we going in the right direction, but we had no idea like what the bar actually was. And so we threw a huge amount of resources at trying to make the strongest bot possible. So we use C++, it was paralyzed. We were using I think, like 1000 CPUs, maybe, maybe more actually. And, you know, today that sounds like nothing. But for a grad student back in 2016, that was a huge amount of resources, it was still",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,"super stressful. I mean, I thought going into it that we had like a 5050 chance, because basically, I thought if if they play in a totally normal style, I think will squeak out a win. But there's always a chance that they can find some weakness in the bottom. And if they do, and we're playing, like, for 20 days, 120,000 hands of poker, they have a lot of time to find weaknesses in the system. And if they do, we're gonna get crushed. And that's actually what happened in the previous competition. The humans, you know, they started out, it wasn't like, they were winning from the start. But then they found these weaknesses that they could take advantage of. And for the next they know, like, 10 days, they were just just crushing the bots stealing money from it,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,"What they found is Yeah, over betting, like betting certain amounts, the bot would have a lot of trouble dealing with those sizes. And then also, when the bot got into really difficult all in situations, it wasn't able to because it wasn't doing search, it had to clump different hands together, and it wouldn't, it would treat them identically. And so it wouldn't be able to distinguish, you know, like, having a king high flush versus an ace high flush. And in some situations, that really matters a lot. And so they could put the bot into those situations, and then the bot would would just bleed money.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,"So we had set up the competition, you know, like I said, there was $200,000 in prize money. And they would get paid a fraction of that, depending on how well they did relative to each other. Yeah, so I was kind of hoping that they wouldn't work together to try to find weaknesses in the bot. But they entered the competition with their like, number one objective being to beat the bot, and they didn't care about like individual glory, they were like, We're all gonna work as a team to try to take down this bot. And so they immediately started comparing notes, what they would do is they would coordinate looking at different parts of the strategy to try to try to you know, find out weaknesses. And then at the end of the day, we actually sent them a log of all the hands that were played and what cards the bot had on each of those hands.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Oh, yeah, that's good. See? Yeah,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"it was honestly I'm not sure why we did that in retrospect, but I mean, I'm glad we did because we ended up winning anyway. But that if you've ever played poker before, like that is golden information. I mean, no Usually when you play poker, you see about a third of the hands to showdown. And to just hand them all the cards that the bot had on every single hand. That was just just a goldmine for them. And so then they would review the hands and try to see like, Okay, could they find patterns in the bot weaknesses? And could they, then then they would coordinate and study together and try to figure out okay, now, this person is going to explore this part of the strategy for weaknesses, this person is gonna explore this part of the strategy for weaknesses.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,"Well, that's, that's one way of putting it. I wasn't super confident. Yeah. So, you know, going into, like I said, I think I had like, 5050 odds on us winning the, when we actually when we announced the competition, the poker community decided to gamble on who would win. And their initial odds against us were like four to one, they, they were really convinced that the humans were going to pull out when the bot ended up winning for three days straight. And even then, after three days, the betting odds were still just 5050. And then at that point, it started to look like the humans were coming back. They started to like, you know, but but poker is a very high variance game. And I think what happened is like, they thought that they spotted some weaknesses that weren't actually there. And then around day eight, it was just very clear that they were getting absolutely crushed. And from that point, for, for a while there, I was super stressed out, thinking like, Oh, my God, the humans are coming back. And we're just they found weaknesses. And now we're just gonna lose the whole thing. But no, it ended up going in the other direction. And the bot ended up like crushing them in the long run.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

So this is a real benchmark, unlike anything else.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah. And I mean, this is, this is what I had been dreaming about, since I was like 16, playing poker, you know, with my friends in high school, the idea that you could find a strategy, you know, approximate the Nash equilibrium, able to beat all the poker players in the world with it, you know, so to actually see that come to fruition and be realized. That was, it's kind of magical.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, especially money's on the line, too. It's a different it's different than chess. And that aspect, like people get, that's why you want to look at betting markets, if you want to actually understand what people really think in the same sense poker, it's really high stakes, because it's money. And to solve that game, that's, that's an amazing accomplishment. So the leap from that to multi way six player poker, what's, how difficult is that jump? And what are some interesting differences between heads up poker and, and multi-way Poker?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, so I mentioned, you know, Nash equilibrium in two player zero sum games. If you play that strategy, you are guaranteed to not lose an expectation no matter what your opponent does. Now, once you go to six player poker, you're no longer playing a two player zero sum game. And so there was a lot of debate among the academic community and among the poker community about how well these techniques would extend beyond just two player heads up poker. Now, what I have come to realize is that the techniques actually I thought really would extend to six player poker because even though in theory, they don't give you these guarantees, as a two player zero sum games, in practice, it still gives you a really strong strategy. Now, there were a lot of complications that would come up with six player poker besides like the game theoretic aspects, I mean, for one, the game is just exponentially larger. So the main thing that allowed us to go from two player to six player was the idea of depth limited search. So I said before, like, you know, we would do search, we would plan out, the ball would plan out, like what it's going to do next, and for the next several moves, and in the broadest that search was done, extending all the way to the end of the game. So we'd have to start it from from the turn onwards, like looking maybe 10 moves ahead, it would have to figure out what it was doing for all those moves. Now, when you get to six player poker, it can't do that exhaustive search anymore because the game is just way too large. But by only having to look a few moves ahead and then stopping there and substituting a value estimate of like, how good is that strategy at that point, then we're able to do a much more scalable form of search.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Is there something cool looking at the paper? I know, there's something cool in the paper in terms of graphics, a game tree traversal via Monte Carlo,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I think if you go down a bit,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,figure one an example of equilibrium selection problem. Ooh. So yeah. What do we know about equilibria? One is there's multiple players.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So when you go outside of two players, you're a sum. So a Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies like one strategy for each player, where no player has an incentive to switch to a different strategy. And so you can kind of think of it as like, imagine, you have a game where there's a ring, that's actually the visual here, you got a ring, and the object of the game is to be as far away from the other players as possible. There's a Nash equilibrium is for all the players to be spaced equally apart around this ring. But there's infinitely many different Nash equilibria, right, there's infinitely many ways to space for dots along the ring. And if every single player independently computes a Nash equilibrium, then there's no guarantee that the joint strategy that they're all playing, is going to result is going to be a Nash equilibrium there, they're just going to be like random dots scattered along this ring, rather than for coordinated dots being equally spaced apart, is it possible",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,to sort of optimally do this kind of selection? To do the selection of the equilibria you're chasing? So is there like a meta problem to be solved here?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So the meta problem is, in some sense, how do you how do you understand the Nash equilibria that the other players are going to play? And, and even if you do that, again, there's no guarantee that you're going to win. So you know, if you're playing, if you're playing risk, like I said, and all the other players decide to team up against you, you're gonna lose Nash equilibrium doesn't help you there. And so there is this big debate about whether Nash equilibrium and all these techniques that compute it are even useful once you go outside a two player zero sum games. Now, I think for many games, there is a valid criticism here. And I think when we talk about when we go to something like diplomacy, we run into this issue that the approach of trying to approximate a Nash equilibrium doesn't really work anymore. But it turns out that in six player poker, because six player poker is such an adversarial game, where none of the players really try to work with each other. The techniques that were used into player poker to try to approximate an equilibrium, those still end up working in practice. In six player poker,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"there's some deep way in which six player poker is just a bunch of heads up poker, like games in one. It's like, it's like embedded in it. So the competitiveness is more fundamental to poker than the cooperation,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"right? Yeah, poker is just such an adversarial game, there's no real cooperation. In fact, you're not even allowed to cooperate in poker, it's considered collusion. It's against the rules. And so for that reason, that techniques end up working really well. And I think that's true more broadly, in extremely adversarial games in general,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,but that's sort of in practice versus being able to prove something.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"That's right. Nobody has a proof that that's the case. And it could be that that six player poker belongs to some class of games, where a approximating a Nash equilibrium through self play provably works well. And you know, there are other classes of games beyond just two player zero sum where this is proven to work well. So there are these kinds of games called potential games, which I won't go into. It's kind of like a complicated concept. But there are classes of games where this approach to approximating a Nash equilibrium is proven to work well. Now six player poker is not known to belong to one of those classes. But it is possible that there is some classic games where it either provably performs well or provably performs not that badly.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,"I personally, I think the most interesting interesting thing about Pluribus is that it was so much cheaper than LeBron is, I mean, LeBron is, if you had to put a price tag on the computational resources that went into it. I would say the final training runs about $100,000. You go to Pluribus. The final training run would cost like less than $150 on AWS.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,"No, no, it's not. It's I mean, first of all, like Yeah, computing resources are getting cheaper every day and like, but you're not going to see 1000 fold decrease in the computational resources over two years. or even anywhere close to that the real improvement was algorithmic improvements. And in particular, the ability to do depth limited search.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So it does depth limited search also worked for libres.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yep, yes. So where this depth limited search came from is, you know, I developed this technique and ran it on to player poker first. And that reduced the computational resources needed to make an AI that was superhuman, from, you know, $100,000, for the Broadus to something you could train on your laptop.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,What do you learn from the from that discovery?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,What I would take away from that is that algorithmic improvements really do matter.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"How would you describe the more general case of limited depth search? So it's basically constraining the scale a temporal or in some other way of the computation you're doing in some clever way? So like, with, like, how else can you significantly constrained computation? Right?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Well, I think the idea is that we want to be able to leverage search as much as possible. And the way that we were doing it in the broadest required us to search all the way to the end of the game. Now, if you're playing a game like chess, the idea that you're gonna search always to the end of the game is kind of unimaginable, right? Like, there's just so many situations where you just won't be able to use search in that case, or the cost would be, you know, prohibitive. And this technique allowed us to leverage search, and without having to pay such a huge computational cost for it, and be able to apply it more broadly.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So to what degree did you use neural nets for libres and Pluribus, and more generally, what role Jinyuan that have to play in and superhuman level performance in poker.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So we actually did not use neural nets at all for libres, or Pluribus. And a lot of people found this surprising back in 2017, I think they find it surprising today that we were able to do this without using any neural nets. And I think the reason for that, I mean, I think neural nets are incredibly powerful. And the techniques that are used today, even for poker API's, do rely quite heavily on neural nets. But it wasn't the main challenge for poker, like I think what neural nets are really good for, if you're in a situation where finding features for a value function is really difficult, then neural nets are really powerful. And this was the problem and go, right, like the problem and go was that were the final problem and go at least, was that nobody had a good way of looking at a board and figuring out who was winning or losing describing through a simple algorithm who was winning or losing. And so their neural nets were super helpful, because you could just feed in a ton of different board positions into this neural net, and it would be able to predict then who was winning or losing. But in poker, the features weren't the challenge. The challenge was, how do you design a scalable algorithm that would allow you to find this balance strategy? That would understand that you have to bluff with the right probability?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So Can that be somehow incorporated into the value function, this the complexity of poker that you've described?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, so the way the value functions work in poker, like the latest and greatest poker API's, they do use neural nets for the value function. The way it's done is is very different from how it's done in a game like chess or go because in poker, you have to reason about beliefs. And so the value of a state depends on the beliefs that players have about what the different cards are. Like, if you have pocket aces, then whether that's a really, really good hand or just an okay hand, depends on whether you know, I have pocket aces, right? Like, if you know that I have pocket aces, then if I bet you're going to fold immediately, but if you think that I've a really bad hands, then I could bet with pocket aces and make a ton of money. So the value function in poker these days, takes the beliefs as an input, which is very different from like how Chess and Go AI's work.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So as a person who appreciates the game? Who do you think is the greatest poker player of all time?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,That's a That's a tough question.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Can AI help answer that question? Can you can actually analyze the quality of play, right? So the chess engines can can give estimates of the quality of play, right? I wonder if there's a is there an ELO rating type of system for poker? I suppose you could, but there's just not enough. You would have to play a lot of games, right? A very large number of games like more than you would in chess. A deterministic game makes it easier to estimate your I think",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I think it is much harder to estimate something like a low rating in poker. I think it's doable. The problem is that the game has very high variance. So you could play you could be profitable. Will in poker for a year. And you could actually be a bad player just because the variance is so high. I mean, you've got top professional poker players that would lose for a year, just because they're on a really bad, bad streak.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So yeah, so for you, you have to have a nice clean way of saying if player a player B, and a BS B that says something that's a signal in poker is a very noisy signal. It's",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"a very noisy signal. Now there is a signal there. And so you could do this, this calculation, it would just be much harder. But the same way that AI is have now taken over chess and you know, all the top professional chess players train with with AIs. The same is true for poker, the game has become a very computational people train with AI is to try to find out where they're making mistakes, try to learn from the AIS to improve their strategy. So now, yeah, so the game has been revolutionized in the past five years by by the development of AI in the sport, the",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,skill with which you avoided the question of the greatest of all time was impressive.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So my feeling is that it's a difficult it's a difficult question, because just like in chess, where you can't really compare Magnus Carlsen today to Garry Kasparov. Because the game has evolved so much. The poker players today are so far beyond the skills of like people that were playing even 10 or 20 years ago. So you look at the kinds of like all stars that were on ESPN, add like the height of the poker, boom. Pretty much all those players are actually not that good at the game today, at least at least the the strategy aspect, I mean, there's might be still be good at like reading the player at the other side of the table and trying to figure out like, are they bluffing or not. But in terms of the actual, like, computational strategy of the game, a lot of them have really struggled to keep up with that development. Now. So for that reason, I'll give an answer on I'm gonna say Daniel Negreanu, who you actually had on the podcast recently, I saw as a great episode, and I love this. Yeah.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And Phil's gonna hate this so much.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Lex Fridman,"So he's trying to he's constantly studying the game theory, optimal way of playing.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Exactly. Yeah. And I think a lot of a lot of the old school poker players are just kind of given up on that aspect. And I got to get that in the grand new credit for for keeping up with all the developments that are happening in the sport.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, it's fascinating to watch. It's fascinating to watch where it's headed. Yeah, so there you go. Some love for Daniel. quick pause, bathroom break. Let's do it. Let's go from poker to diplomacy. What is at a high level the game of diplomacy?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, so I talked a lot about two player zero sum games. And what's interesting about diplomacy is that it's very different from these like adversarial games like chess, go poker, even Starcraft and Dota. diplomacy has a much bigger cooperative element to it. It's a seven player game, it was actually created in the 50s. And it takes place before World War One, it's like a map of Europe with seven great powers. And they're all trying to form alliances with each other. There's a lot of negotiation going on. And so the whole focus of the game is on forming alliances with the other players to take on the other players,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"England, Germany, Russia, Turkey, Austria, Hungary, Italy, and France.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"That's right. Yeah. So the way the game works, is, on each turn, you're spend about, you know, five to 15 minutes talking to the other players in privates. And you make all sorts of deals with them, you say, like, hey, let's work together. You know, let's team up against this other player, because the only way that you can make progress is by working with somebody else against the others. And then after that negotiation period is done. All the players simultaneously submit their moves, and they're all executed at the same time. And so you can tell people like, Hey, I'm going to support you this turn, but then you don't follow through with it. And they're only going to figure that out. Once they see the movies being read off.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"How much of it is natural language, like written, actual text, how much is like, you're actually saying phrases that are structured.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So there's different ways to play the game. You can play it in person. And in that case, it's all natural language, freeform communication, there's no constraints on the kinds of deals that you can make the kinds of things that you can discuss. You can also play it online. So you can, you know, send long emails back and forth. You can play it like live online or voice chats. But the focus, the important thing to understand is that this is unstructured communication. You can say whatever you want. You can make any sorts of deals that you want, and everything is done privately. So it's not like you're all around the board together. having a conversation, you're grabbing somebody's going off into a corner, and conspiring behind everybody else's back about what you're planning.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And there's no limit, in theory to the conversation could have directly with one person.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"That's right, you can make all sorts of you could talk about anything. You could say like, Hey, let's have a long term alliance against this guy, you can say like, Hey, can you support me this turn and return? I'll do this other thing for you next turn, or, you know, yeah, just you can talk about, like what you talked about with somebody else, and gossip about, like, what they're planning. The way that I would describe the game is that it's kind of like a mix between risk poker, and the TV show survivor. There's like this big elements of like, trying to, yeah, there's a big social element. And the best way that I would describe the game is that it's really a game about people rather than the pieces.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So risk, because it is a map, it's kind of war game like poker, because there's a game theory component that's very kind of strategic. So you could convert it into an artificial intelligence problem, and then survive it because of the social component. That's a strong social component. I saw that somebody said online that the internet version of the game has this quality of this easier to almost to do like role playing, as opposed to being yourself, you can actually like, be the like, really imagine yourself as the leader of France, or Russia and so on, like, really pretend to be that person, it's actually fun to really lean into being that that leader?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, so some, some players do go this route, where they just like, kind of view it as a strategy game, but also a role playing game where they can like act out, like, what would I be like if I was, you know, leader of France in 1900",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Forfeit right away? And they sometimes use like, the old timey language to like, or how they imagined the lease would talk at that time. Anyway, so the what are the different turns of the game? Like, what are the rounds?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, so on every turn, you got like, a bunch of different units that you start out with. So you start out, controlling like, just a few units, and the object of the game is to gain control of the majority of the map, if you're able, if you're able to do that, then you've won the game. But like I said, the only way that you're able to do that is by working with other players. So on every turn, you can issue a move order. So for each of your units, you can move them to an adjacent territory, or you can keep them where they are. Or you can support a move or hold of a different units.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So what are the territories? Well, how is the map divided up,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"it's kind of like risk where the map is divided up into like, 50 different territories. Now, you can enter a territory, if you're moving into that territory with more support than the person that's in there, or the person that's trying to move in there. So if you're moving in, and then somebody's already there, then if neither of you have support, it's a one versus one, and you'll bounce back, and neither of you will make progress. If you have a unit that's supporting that move into the territory, then it's a two versus one, and you'll kick them out, and they'll have to retreat somewhere. What a support me support is like, it's an action that you can issue in the game. So you can say, this unit, you write down this unit is supporting this other unit into this territory,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,or these units from opposing forces. They could be,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"they could be and this is, this is where the interesting aspect of the game comes in, because you can support your own units into territory. But you can also support other people's units into territories. And so that's what the negotiations really revolve around.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"But you don't have to do the thing you say you're going to do is Yeah, and so that you can say I'm going to support you but then backstabbed the person. Yeah, that's absolutely right. And that tension is core to the game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"That tension is absolutely core to the game, the the fact that you can make all sorts of promises, but you have to reason about the fact that like a they might not trust you, if you say you're going to do something, or they might be lying to you, when they say they're going to support you.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So maybe just just to jump back what's what's the history of the game in general? Is it true that Henry Kissinger love the game? And JFK and all those that I've heard like a bunch of different people that or is that just one of those things that the cool kids say they do, but they don't actually play?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So the game was created in the 50s. And from what I understand it was JFK days it was played in like the JFK White House Henry Kissinger's favorite game. I don't know if it's true, but that's definitely what I've heard. It's",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"interesting that they went with World War One, when it was created after World War Two.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So the story that I've heard for the creation of the game is it was created by somebody that had looked at the history of the 20th century, and they saw World War One as a failure of diplomacy. So sure, you know, they saw the fact that this war broke out as like the diplomats of all these countries like really failed to prevent a war and he wanted to create a game that would basically teach people about diplomacy. And it's really fascinating that like in his ideal version of the game of diplomacy, nobody actually wins the game. Because the whole point is that if somebody is about to win, then the other players should be able to work together to stop that person from winning. And so the ideal version of the game is just one where nobody actually wins. And, you know, it's kind of nice, like, wholesome take home message then that, you know, war war is ultimately futile. And",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"and that optimal that futile, optimal could be achieved through great diplomacy. Yep. So is there some asymmetry in in terms of which is more powerful Russia versus Germany versus France, and so on?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So I think the general consensus is that France is the strongest power in the game. But the beautiful thing about diplomacy is that it's self balancing. Right. So the fact that France has an inherent advantage from the beginning, means that the other players are less likely to work with it.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So that Russia has four units, verse four, have something that the others have three of something",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"that's true. Yeah. So Russia starts off with four units, while they all the other players start with three. But Russia is also in a much more vulnerable position, because they have to like, they have a lot more neighbors as well.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Larger territory more. Yeah, right. More border to defend. Okay. What else is, what else is important to know about the rules? So they're there? How many rounds are there? Like, is this iterative game is there is is a finite just keep going indefinitely.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Usually, the game lasts, I would say about 15, or 20. Turns. There's, in theory, no limit, it could last longer. But at some point, I mean, if you're playing a house game with friends, at some point is get tired. And you all agree like, Okay, we're going to end the game here and call it a draw. If you're playing online, there's usually like set limits on when the game will actually end.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And what's the end? What's the termination condition like this, this one country have to conquer everything else.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So if somebody is able to actually gain control of a majority of the map, then then they've won the game. And that is a solo victory, as it's called. Now, that pretty rarely happens, especially with strong players, because like I said, the game is designed to incentivize the other players to put a stop to that and all work together to stop the superpower. Usually, what ends up happening is that, you know, all the players agree to withdraw. And then the score, the win is divided among the remaining players. There's a lot of different scoring systems, the one that we used in our research, basically, gives a score relative to how much control you have of the map. So the more that you control, the higher your score.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,What's the history of using this game as a benchmark for AI research? To? Do people use it?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, so people have been working on AI for diplomacy since about the 80s. There was some really exciting research back then. But the approach that was taken was very different from what we see today, the research in the 80s was a very rule based approach, kind of kind of a heuristic approach is very in line with the kind of research that was being done in the 80s. You know, basically trying to encode human knowledge into the strategy of the AI. Sure. And, you know, it's understandable, I mean, the game is so incredibly different. And so, so much more complicated than the kinds of games that people working on like chess, and go, and poker that it was honestly even hard to, like, start getting making any progress in diplomacy. Can you just",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"formulate, what is the problem from an AI perspective? And why is it hard? Was it a challenging game to solve?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So there's a lot of aspects in diplomacy that make it a huge challenge. First of all, you have the natural language components. And I think this really is what makes it really the most difficult game among like, the major benchmarks, the fact that you have to it's not about moving pieces on the board. Your action space is basically all the different sentences that you could communicate to somebody else in his game. And",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"is there Can we just like linger on that. So it's part of it, like the ambiguity in language, if it was like, very strict, if you narrow the set of possible sentences, you could do it with that simplify the game significantly.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"The real difficulty is the breadth of things that you can talk about. You can have natural language and other games, like Settlers of Catan, for example, you could have a natural language Settlers of Catan AI, but the things that you're going to talk about are basically like, am I treating you to sheep for water, three sheep for wood. Whereas in a game like diplomacy, the breadth of conversations that you're going to have or like, you know, am I going to support you or are you going to support me in return which units are going to do what's what did this other person sit promise you? They're lying because they told this other person that they're going to do this instead. If you helped me out this turn, then in the future, I'll do these things that will help you out. The the depth and breadth of these conversations is really complex. created. And it's all being done in natural language. Now you could approach it. And we actually consider doing this, like, you know, having a simplified language to make this complexity smaller. But ultimately, we thought, the most impactful way of doing this research would be to help address the natural language component head on, and just try to go for the full game upfront.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Just looking at sample games, and what the conversations look like greetings, England, this should prove to be a fun game, since all the private press is going to be made public at the end. At the least, it will be interesting to see if the press changes because of that. Anyway, good. Okay. So there's like,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"yeah, that's just kind of like the generic readings at the beginning of the game. I think that the meat comes a little bit later, when you're starting to talk about like, specific strategy and stuff.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I agree. There are a lot of advantages to the two of us keeping in touch, and our nation's make strong natural allies in the middle game. So that kind of stuff, making friends making enemies.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, right. Like, if you look at the next line, so the person is saying, like, I've heard bits about a Panto, and an octopus opening and basically telling Austria like, hey, just a heads up. You know, I've heard these whispers about like, what might be going on behind your back?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah. So there's all kinds of complexities in that, in the, in the language of that, right. Like to interpret what that what that means. It's hard for us humans, but for AI, it's even harder, because you have to understand, like, at every level, the semantics of that,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"right. I mean, there's this is a complexity and understanding when somebody is saying this to me, what does that mean? And then there's also the complexity of like, should I be telling this person this? Like, I've overheard these these whispers? Should I be telling this person that like, Hey, you might be getting attacked by by this other power?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Okay, so what how we're supposed to think about okay, so that's the natural language? How do you even begin trying to solve this game? It seems like, this seems like the Turing test on steroids.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah. And I mean, there's, there's the natural language aspect. And then even besides the natural language aspect, you also have the the cooperative elements of the game. And I think this is actually something that I find really interesting, if you look at all the previous game AI, breakthroughs, they've all happened in these purely adversarial games where you don't actually need to understand how humans play the game. It's all just AI versus AI. Right? Like you look at checkers, chess, go poker, Starcraft Dota. Two, like in some of those cases, they leveraged human data, but they never needed to, they were always just trying to have a scalable algorithm, that then they could throw a lot of computational resources out a lot of memory out. And then eventually, it would converge to an approximation of a Nash equilibrium, this perfect strategy, that in a two player zero sum game guarantees that they're going to be able to not lose to any opponents.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So you can leverage self play. So this game, you",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"you can leverage self play, but it's no longer sufficient to beat humans.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So how do you integrate the human into the loop of this, so what you",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"have to do is incorporate human data. And to kind of give you some intuition for why this is the case. Like imagine you're playing a negotiation game like like diplomacy. But you're training completely from scratch. Without any human data that the AI is not going to suddenly like, figure out how to communicate in English, it's going to figure out some weird robot language that only it will understand. And then when you stick that in a game with six other humans, they're going to think this person is talking gibberish, and they're just going to ally with each other and team up against the bot. Or not even keep up against the ball, but just not work with the bot. And so in order to be able to play this game with humans, it has to understand the human way of playing the game, not this machine way of playing the game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah. Yeah, that's fascinating. So right, the nuanced thing to understand because the chess playing program doesn't need to play like a human to beat a human Exactly. But here you have to play like a human in order to beat them.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Or at least you have to understand how humans play the game so that you can understand how to work with them. If they have certain expectations about what does it mean to be a good ally? What does it mean to have like a reciprocal relationship where we're working together, you have to abide by those conventions? And if you don't, they're just gonna work with somebody else instead.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Do you think of this as a clean in some deep sense of the spirit of the Turing test is formulated by Alan Turing is it is some sense this is what the Turing test actually looks like. So because of open ended natural language conversation seems like very difficult to evaluate, like here at a high stakes where humans are trying to win a game that seems like how you actually perform the Turing test.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I think it's different from the Turing test, like the way that the Turing test is formulated. It's about trying to distinguish a human from a machine and seeing Okay, Did the machine successfully pass as a human in this adversarial setting where the aid where the player is trying to figure out whether it's a machine or human, whereas in diplomacy, it's not about trying to figure out whether this player is a human or machine. It's ultimately about whether I can work with this player, regardless of whether they are human or machine. And can the machine do that better than a human can?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, I'm gonna think about that. But that just feels like the implied requirement for that is for the machine to be human. Like,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I think that's, I think that's true that if you're going to play in this human game, you have to somehow adapt to the, to the human surroundings, and the human playstyle.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And to win, you have to adapt. So you can't if you're the outsider, if you're not human, like I feel like that's a losing strategy.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I think that's I think that's correct.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Yeah. Yeah. So okay. What are the complexities here? What was your approach to it?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Before I get to that, one thing I should explain, like why we decided to work on diplomacy here. So basically, what happened is in 2019, I was wrapping up the work on Sixth player poker on Pluribus. And it was trying to think about what to work on next. And I had been seeing like all these other breakthroughs happening in AI, I mean, like, 2019, you have StarCraft, you have alphastar, beating humans and StarCraft, you've got the Dota, two stuff happening at open AI, you have GPT, two or DVD three, I think the GPT, two at the time. And it became clear that AI was progressing really, really rapidly. And people were throwing out these like other games about, you know, what should be the next challenge for multi agent AI. And I just felt like we had to aim bigger. If you look at a game, like chess, or a game like go, they took decades for researchers to to ultimately reach superhuman performance that I mean, like chess took four years of AI research, go took another 20 years. And we thought that diplomacy would be this incredibly difficult challenge that could easily take a decade to make an AI that could play competently. But we felt like That was that was a goal worth aiming for. And so honestly, I was kind of reluctant to work on it at first, because I thought it was like, too far out of the realm of possibility. But, you know, I was talking to a co worker of mine, Adam Lear. And he was basically saying, like, why not aim for it? You know, we'll learn some interesting things along the way. And maybe it'll be possible. And so we decided to go for it. And I think I think it was the right choice, considering just how much progress there there was in AI, and that that progress has continued in the years since",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"so winning and diplomacy. What does that really look like? It means talking to six other players, six other entities, agents, and convincing and convincing them have stuff that you want them to be convinced of? Like, what exactly I'm trying to get like to deeply understand what the problem is.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Ultimately, the problem is, it's simple to quantify, right? Like, you're going to play this game with humans, and you want your score on average to be as high as possible. You know, if you can say like, I am winning more than any any human alive, then you're a champion diplomacy player. Now, ultimately, we haven't we didn't reach that we got to human level performance, we actually, so we played about 40 games with with real humans online. The bot came in second of all players that played five or more games. And so not like number one, but way, way higher than what was",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"the expertise level? Are they beginners? Are they intermediate players, advanced players? So in",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"that sense, that's a great question. So I think this kind of goes into how do you measure the performance in diplomacy. And I would argue that when you're measuring performance in a game like this, you don't actually want to measure it in games with all expert players. It's kind of like if you're developing a self driving car, you don't want to measure that car on the road with a bunch of experts don't traverse Yeah, you want to put it on a road of like an actual American city and see is this car crashing less often than an expert driver would? So that's the metric that we've used. We were saying, like, we're gonna stick this game, we're gonna stick this bot in games with a wide variety of skill levels. And then are we doing better than a stronger expert human player would in the same situation?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"That's quite brilliant because I played a lot of sports in my life, like as a tennis judo, whatever. And it's somehow almost easier to go against experts almost always. I think they're more predictable in the quality of play. The space of strategies you're operating under is narrower against experts. It's more fun. It's really frustrating against beginners. Also, because Beginners talk trash to you, when they somehow do beat you says, that's a human thing that they are designed to be worried about that. But yeah, the variance in strategies is greater, especially with natural language, it's just all over the place, then.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, and honestly, when you look at what makes a good human diplomacy player, obviously, they're able to handle themselves in games with other expert humans, but where they really shine is when they're playing with these weak players. And they know how to take advantage of the fact that they're a weak player that they won't be able to like pull off a stab as well, or that they have certain tendencies. And they can take them under their wing and persuade them to do things that might not even be in their interest. They're really good diplomacy players are able to take advantage of the fact that there that there are some weak players in the game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Okay, so if you have to incorporate human play data, how do you do that? How do you do that in order to train an AI system to play diplomacy?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, so that's, that's really the crux of the problem. How do we leverage the benefits of self play that have been so successful in all these other previous games, while keeping the strategy as as human compatible as possible. And so what we did is we first trained a language model. And then we made that language model controllable. On a set of a set of intents, we call intents, which are basically like an action that we want to play, and an action that we would like the other player to play. And so this gives us a way to generate dialogue, that's not just trying to imitate the human style, whatever a human would say, in this situation, but to actually give it a an intent of purpose in its communication, we can talk about a specific move, or we can make a specific request. And the determination of what that move is that we're discussing comes from strategic strategic reasoning model that uses reinforcement learning and planning.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So the computing the intense for all the players. How's that done? Just as a as a starting point? Is that with reinforcement learning? Or is that just optimal? Determining what the optimal is for intense,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"it's a combination of reinforcement learning and planning, actually very similar to how you approach how we approached poker and how people approached like Chess and Go as well. We're using self play, and and search to try to figure out what are what is an optimal move for us, and what is a desirable move that we would like this other player to play? Now, the difference between the way that we approached reinforcement learning and search in this game, versus those previous games, is that we have to keep it human compatible, we have to understand how the other person is likely to play rather than just assuming that they're going to play like a machine,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"and how language gets them to play in a way that maximize the chance of following the intent you want them to follow. Okay, how do you how do you do that? How do you? How do you connect language to intent,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"so the way that RL and planning is done is actually not using language. So we're coming up with this like plan for the action that we're gonna play in the other person's gonna play. And then we feed that action into the dialogue model, that will then send a message according to those plans.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So the language model there is mapping action to message to message, one word at a time.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Basically, one message at a time. So will will feed into the dialogue model, like here are the actions that you should be discussing, here's the message, here's like the, the contents of the message that we would like you to send, and then it will actually generate a message that corresponds to that, okay, does this actually work? It works surprisingly well.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Okay, how? And the number of ways it probably goes horribly, I would have imagined it goes horribly wrong. So how the heck is it effective at all?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I mean, there are a lot of ways that this could fail. So for example, I mean, you could have a situation where you're, you're basically like, we don't tell the the language model, like here are the pieces of our action or the other person's action that you should be communicating. And so like, let's say you're about to attack somebody, you probably don't want to tell them that you're going to attack them. But there's nothing in the language like the language model is not very smart at the end of the day. So it doesn't really have a way of knowing like, well, what should I be talking about? Should I tell this person that I'm about to attack them or not? So we have to, like develop a lot of other techniques that that deal with that. Like one of the things we do, for example, is we try to calculate, if I'm going to send this message, what would I expect the other person to do in response? So if it's a message like, Hey, I'm going to attack you this turn, they're probably going to, you know, attack us or defend against that attack. And so we have a way of recognizing like, hey, sending this message is a negative expected value action and we should not send this message.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So you have for particular kinds of messages. You have like an extra function that does the have estimated the value of that message.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Yeah. So we have these kinds of filters that like to filter.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So there's a good is that filter on your network? Or is it rule based?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"That's, that's a neural network. So we're, well, it's a it's a combination. It's a neural network, but it's also using planning. It's trying to compute like, what is the policy that the other players are going to play given that this message has been sent? And then is that better than not sending the message or, or feel like",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"that's how my brain works to like, there's a language model that generates random crap. And then there's these other neural nets that are essentially filters. At least that's when I tweet. I'll usually my process of tweeting, I'll think of something. And it's hilarious to me. And then about five seconds later, the filter network comes in and says, no, no, it's not funny at all. That me there's some something interesting to that kind of process. So you have a set of actions that you you want, you have an intent, the you want to achieve an intent that you want your opponent to achieve the generate messages, and then you evaluate those messages will achieve the the goal you want.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, we're filtering for several things. We're filtering, like, is this a sensible message, you know, so sometimes language models will send will generate messages that are just like, totally nonsense. And we try to filter those out, we also try to filter out messages that that are basically lies. So, you know, diplomacy has this reputation as a game that's really about deception and lying. But we try to actually minimize the amount that the bot would lie. This was actually mostly or are",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,you scared?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I mean, like, part of the reason for this is that we actually found that lying, would make the bot perform worse, in the long run, it would end up with a lower score. Because once the bot lies, people will never trust it again. And trust is a huge aspect of the game of diplomacy notes",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"here, because I think this is applies to, to life lessons two,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"oh, I think it's a really yeah, really strong. So",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,"Yeah, I mean, I think when people play diplomacy for the first time, they approach it as a game of deception and lying. And, and they ultimately, if you talk to top diplomacy players, what they'll tell you is that diplomacy is a game about trust, and being able to build trust in an environment that encourages people to not trust anyone. So that's the ultimate tension in diplomacy. How can this AI reason about whether you are being honest in your communication? And how can the AI persuade you that it is being honest, when it is telling you that, hey, I'm actually going to support you this turn?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Is there some sense I don't know if you step back and think that this process will indirectly help us study human psychology? So like, if trust is the ultimate goal, would not help us understand what are the fundamental aspects of forming trust between humans and between humans and AI? I mean, that's a really, really important question that's much bigger than the strategy games is how can this fundamental to the human robot interaction problem? How do we form trust between intelligent entities?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So one of the things I'm really excited about with diplomacy, there's never really been a good domain to investigate these kinds of questions. And diplomacy gives us a domain where trust is really at the center of it. And it's not just like you've hired a bunch of mechanical Turkers that, you know, are being paid and trying to get through the task as quickly as possible. You have these people that are really invested in the outcome of the game, and they're really trying to do the best that they can. And so I'm really excited that we're able to, we actually, like have put together this, we're open sourcing all of our models, we're open sourcing, all of the all the code, and we're making the data that we've used available to researchers, so that they can investigate these kinds of questions.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

We're setting up a system where researchers will be able to apply to be able to gain access to that data and be able to to use it in their own research, which is to say, what is",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"the name of the system? We're calling the bot Cicero, Cicero. And what's the name like that? You're open sourcing? What's the name of the repository and, and the like the project?

Noam Brown,"The data set comes from this website, web diplomacy.net Is the site that's been online for like 20 years now and it's been One of the main sites that people use to play diplomacy on it, we've got like 50,000 games of diplomacy with natural language communication, over 10 million messages. So it's a pretty massive data set that people can use to. We're hoping that the academic community, the research community, is able to use it for all sorts of interesting research questions.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,"Yeah, absolutely. And I think it's, I think it's maybe the best data set that I can think of out there to to investigate these kinds of questions of negotiation, trust, persuasion, I wouldn't say it's the best data set in the world for human AI interaction. That's a very broad field. But I think that it's definitely up there as like, you know, if you're really interested in language models interacting with humans in, you know, a setting where their incentives are not fully aligned. This seems like an ideal data set for investigating that. So",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"you have you have a paper with some impressive results, and just an impressive paper that taking this problem on what's the most exciting thing to you in terms of the results from the paper? Well, I think there's ideas or results.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, I think there's a few aspects of the results, and that I think, are really exciting. So first of all, the fact that we were able to achieve such strong performance, I was surprised by and pleasantly surprised by. So we played 40 games of diplomacy with real humans, and the bot placed second, out of all players that have played five or more games. So it's about 80 players total 19, of whom played five or more games, and the bot was ranked second out of those players. And the bot was was really good in two dimensions, one, being able to establish strong connections with the other players on the board, being able to, like, persuade them to work with it, being able to coordinate with them about like, how it's going to work with them. And then also the raw, tactical and strategic aspects of the game, you know, being able to understand what the other players are likely to do being able to model their behavior and respond appropriately to that. The bot also really excelled at,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,"you know, like keep it in character. That we actually had a researcher watching the bot 24/7 for a while, whenever we play a game, we had a bot watching it to make sure that it wouldn't go off the rails and start like threatening somebody or something like that. I would",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"just love it if the bots started like mocking, mocking everybody, like some weird quirky strategies would emerge that have you seen anything interesting that you ha, that's a weird, that's a that's a weed behavior, either the filter or the language model? That was weird to you.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"That was yeah, there were definitely like, things that the bot would, would do that were not in line with, like how humans would approach the game. And that in a good way, the humans actually, you know, we've talked to some expert diplomacy players about these results. And their takeaway is that, well, maybe humans are approaching this the wrong way. And this is actually like the right way to play the game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So what's required to win? Like, what? What does it mean to mess up or to exploit the suboptimal behavior of a player? Like, is there? Is there optimally rational behavior and irrational behavior the to estimate that kind of stuff? Like what, what stands out to you? Like, is there a crack that you can exploit? Is there like, a weakness that you can exploit in the game that everybody's looking for?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Well, I think you're asking kind of two questions there. So one, like modeling the irrationality and the sub optimality of humans, you can't in diplomacy, you can't treat all the other players like their machines. And if you do that, you're you're going to end up playing really poorly. And so we actually ran this experiment. So we, we trained a bot, in a two player zero sum version of diplomacy, the same way that you might approach a game like chess or poker, and the bot was superhuman, it would crush any competitor. And then we took that same training approach. And we trained a bot for the full seven player game version of the game through self play, without any human data. And we stuck it in a game with six humans, and it got destroyed. Even in the version of the game where there's no explicit natural language communication. It still got destroyed, because it just wouldn't be able to understand how the other players were approaching the game and be able to work with that.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,"Well, it would, for example, expect the human to support it in a certain way, when the human would simply like, Thank you like, No, I'm not supposed to support you here. It's kind of like, you know, if you develop a self driving car, and it's trained completely from scratch with other self driving cars, it might learn to drive on the left side of the road. And that's a totally reasonable thing to do if you're with these other self driving cars that are also driving on the left side of the road.

Noam Brown,"this is an aspect of two players Euro song versus games that involve cooperation. So in a two player zero sum game, you can do self play from scratch, and you will arrive at the Nash equilibrium, where you don't have to worry about the other player playing in a very human suboptimal style, that's just going to be the only way that deviating from a Nash equilibrium would would change things is if it helped you.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

And so that cooperation element is what makes the game really, really hard.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yep. And to give you an, like, an example of how this sub optimality and irrationality comes into play, there's a really common situation in the game of diplomacy, that where one player starts to win, and they're like, at the point where they're controlling about half the map, yeah, and the remaining players who have all been fighting each other, the whole game, all have to, like work together now to stop this other player from winning, or else everybody's gonna lose. And it's kind of like, you know, Game of Thrones, like, really seen the show, like, you know, he got the the others coming from the north, and like, all the people have to start work out the differences and stop them from from taking over. And the bot will do this, the bot will work with the other players to stop the superpower from winning. But if it doesn't really, if it's trained from scratch, or it doesn't really have a good grounding in how humans approach it, it will also at the same time, attack the other players with its extra units. So all the units that are not necessary to stop the superpower from winning, it will use those to grab as many centers as possible from the other players. And in totally rational play, the other players should just live with that, you know, they have to understand like, hey, a score of one is better than a score of zero. So, so, okay, he's grabbed my centers, but I'll just deal with it. But humans don't act that way. Right? The human gets really angry at the bot and ends up throwing the game. Because, you know, I'm going to screw you over because you did something that's not fair to me.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Got it? And I suppose the model that is the Boss Boss model, that kind of human frustration? Yeah,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"exactly. And so that is something that seems almost impossible to model purely from scratch without any human data. It's a very cultural thing. Yeah. And so you need human data, to be able to understand that, hey, that's how humans behave. And you have to work around that it might be suboptimal and might be rational. But, but that's an aspect of humanity that you have to you have to deal with.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,"That's actually one of the major challenges that we faced in the research that we had a good amount of human data, we had about 50,000 games, what we try to do is leverage as much self play as possible, while still leveraging the human data. So what we do is we do self play, very similar to how it's been done in poker and go, but we try to regularize the self play towards the human data. Basically, the way to think about it is we penalize the bot for choosing actions that are very unlikely under how under the human data set. And so, you",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

And that gives us an approximate that gives us a policy that resembles to some extent how humans actually play the game. Now, this isn't a perfect model of human play. Because we don't have unlimited data. We don't have unlimited neural net that capacity, but it gives us some approximation.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

And so sort of background model formulation that that's useful for the game of diplomacy?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, absolutely. And so for the language model, which is kind of like a separate question, you know, we didn't use the language model during self play training. But we pre trained the language model on, you know, tons of internet data as much as possible. And then we fine tuned it specifically on to diplomacy games. So we are able to, like leverage the wider data set in order to fill in some of the gaps and like how communication happens more broadly, besides just like, specifically in these diplomacy games.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Okay, cool. So what some, what are some interesting things that came to life from this from this work? To you like, what, what are some insights about, about games, where natural language is involved in cooperation, deep cooperation is involved?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Well, I think there's a few insights. So first of all, the fact that you can't rely purely or even largely on soft play that you really have to have an understanding of how humans approach the game. I think that that's one of the major conclusions that I'm drawing from this work. And that is, I think, applicable more broadly to a lot of different games. So we've actually already taken the approaches that we've used in diplomacy and try them on a cooperative card game called Hanabi. And we've had a lot of success in that game as well. On the language side, I think the fact that we were able to control the language model, through this intense approach was very effective. And it allowed us, instead of just imitating how humans would communicate, we're able to go beyond that and able to feed into it superhuman strategies, that it can then, you know, generate messages corresponding to,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,is there something you can say about detecting whether a person or AI is lying or not?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"The bot doesn't explicitly try to calculate whether somebody is lying or not. But what it will do is try to predict what actions they're going to take, given the communications, given the messages that they've sent to us. So given our conversation, what do I think you're going to do? And implicitly, there is a calculation about whether you're lying to me in that, you know, if, if you're based on your messages, if I think you're going to attack me this turn, even though your messages say that you're not, then, you know, essentially, the bot is predicting that you're lying. But it doesn't view it as as lying the same way that we would view it as lying.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,But you could probably reformulate with all the same data and make a classifier lying or not.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, I think I think you could do that. That was not something that we were focused on. But I think that it is possible that, you know, if you came up with some measurements of like, what does it mean to tell a lie? Because there's a spectrum, right? Like, if you're withholding some information, is that a lie? If you mostly telling the truth, but you forgot to mention this, like one action out of like, 10? Is that a lie? It's hard to draw the line. But you know, if you're willing to do that, and then you could possibly use it to do",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"this feels like an argument inside a relationship. Now, what constitutes a lie? Depends what you mean by the definition of the word is, okay. Still, it's fascinating, because trust and lying is all intermixed into this. And it's language models that are becoming more and more sophisticated. It's just a fascinating space to explore. What what do you see as the future of this work? That is inspired by the breakthrough performance that you're getting here with diplomacy?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I think there's a few different directions to take this work. I think really, what it's showing us is the potential that language models have. I mean, I think a lot of people didn't think that this kind of result was possible even today, despite all the progress that's been made in language models. And so it shows us how we can leverage the power of things like self play on top of language models to get increasingly better performance. And the ceiling is really much higher than what we have right now.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Is this transferable somehow to chatbots for the more general task of dialogue, because there is a kind of negotiation here a dance between entities that are trying to cooperate and at the same time, a little bit adversarial, which I think maps somewhat to the general you know, the entire process of Reddit or like internet communication, you you're cooperating, you're adversarial, you have debates you're having camaraderie, all that kind of stuff.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

And you can specify what that is. And, and then the language can corresponds to that intent. Now, I'm not saying that this is, you know, happening imminently.

Noam Brown,"the way that we've approached self play in diplomacy is like, we're trying to come up with good intends to condition the language model on in the space of intense is actions that can be played in the game. Now there is like the potential to have a broader set of intense things like, you know, long term cooperation, or long term objectives, or, you know, gossip about what another player was saying. These are things that we're currently not conditioning the language model on. And so it's not able to, we're not able to control it to say like, oh, you should be talking about this thing right now. But it's quite possible that you could expand the scope of intends to be able to allow it to talk about those things. Now, in the process of doing that, the self play would become much more complicated. And so that is a potential for future work. Okay, the",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,"So we train a neural nets to imitate the human data as closely as possible. And that's what we call the anchor policy. And now, when we're doing self play, the problem with the anchor policy is that it's not a perfect approximation of how humans actually play. Because we don't have infinite data. Because we don't have unlimited neural network capacity. It's actually a relatively suboptimal approximation of how humans actually play. And we can improve that approximation by adding planning and RL. And so what we do is, we get a better approximation, a better model of human play by during the self play process, we say you can deviate from this human anchor policy, if there is an action that has, you know, particularly high expected value. But it would have to be a really high expected value in order to deviate from from this human life policy. So you basically say try to maximize your expected value, while at the same time stay as close as possible to the Human Policy. And there is a parameter that controls those, the relative weighting of those competing objectives.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So the question I have is, how sophisticated can the Anker policy get to have a policy that approximates human behavior? Right? Yep. So as you increase the number of intents, as you generalize the space in which this is applicable, and given that the human data is limited, try to anticipate a policy that works for a much larger number of cases. Like how difficult is the process of forming a damn good anchor policy?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Well, it really comes down to how much human data you have. So it's all about skin and the human data. I think the more human data you have, the better. And I think that that's going to be the major bottleneck in in scaling to, to more complicated domains. But that said, you know, there might be the potential just like in the language model, where we leveraged, you know, tons of data on the internet and then specialized it for diplomacy. There is the future potential that you can leverage huge amounts of data across the board, and then specialize it in the data set that you have for diplomacy and that way, you're essentially augmenting the amount of data that you have.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

And I'm a big believer in conversation, or leaders getting together and having conversations in trying to understand each other. It's fascinating to think, whether each one of those leaders can run a simulation ahead of time. Like if I'm an asshole. What are the possible consequences? If I'm nice? What are the possible consequences? My guess is that if the president United States got together with Volodymyr Zelensky, and Vladimir Putin that there'll be significant benefit to the president, United States not having an ego, of kind of playing down of giving away a lot of chips for the future success of a world. So giving a lot of power to the two presidents have the competing nations to achieve peace. That's my guess. But it'd be nice to run a bunch of simulations. But then you have to have human data, right? You really, because it's like the game of diplomacy is fundamentally different than geopolitics. You need data you need like, I guess that's the question I have, like, how transferable is this to? Like, I don't know, any kind of negotiation, right?

And you don't have, you don't have a well defined action space, you don't have a well defined reward function. These are all things that you really need for reinforcement, learning and planning to be really successful today. Now, there are some domains where you do have that cogeneration is one example. theorem proving mathematics. That's another example where you have a well defined action space, you have a well defined reward function.

Noam Brown,"Yeah, absolutely, we've already started looking into this direction a bit. So we tried to use the techniques that we've developed for diplomacy to make Chess and Go AIs. And what we found is that it led to much more human like strong Chess and Go players, the way that AIS like Stockfish. Today, play is in a very inhuman style, it's very strong, but it's very different from how humans play. And so we can take the techniques that we've developed for diplomacy, we do something similar in, in Chess and Go, and we end up with a bot that's both strong and human like to elaborate on this a bit like one way to approach making a human like AI for chess, is to collect a bunch of human games like a bunch of human Grandmaster games, and just do supervised learning on those games. But the problem is that if you do that, what you end up with is an AI that's substantially weaker than the human grandmasters that you trained on, because the neural net is not able to approximates the nuance of the strategy. If this goes back to the planning thing that that I mentioned, the search thing that I talked about before, that these human grandmasters, when they're playing, they're using search, and they're using planning, and the neural net alone, unless you have a massive neural net, that's like 1000 times bigger than what we have right now, it's not able to approximate those details very effectively. And on the other hand, you can leverage search and planning very heavily, but then what you end up with is an AI that plays in a very different style from how humans play the game. Now, if you strike this intermediate balance by setting the regularization parameters correctly, and say you can do planning, but try to keep it close to the Human Policy, then you end up with an AI that plays in both a very human lifestyle, and a very strong style. And you can actually even tune it to have a certain Ehlo rating. So you can say playing the style of like a 2800 Ehlo.

Lex Fridman,"I wonder if you could do specific type of humans or categories of humans. So not just skill, but style.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, I think so. And so this is this is where the, the research gets interesting. Like, you know, one of the things that I was thinking about is, and this is actually already being done at the there's a researcher at the University of Toronto that's working on this is to make an ad of plays in the style of a particular player. Like Magnus Carlsen, for example, you can make an AI that plays like Magnus Carlsen and that where I think this gets interesting is like, maybe you're up against Magnus Carlsen and the World Championship or something you can play against this Magnus Carlsen bought to prepare against the real Magnus Carlsen and you can try to explore strategies that he might struggle with, and try to figure out like how to beat this player in particular. On the other hand, you can also have Magnus Carlsen working with this bot to try to figure out where he's weak, and where he needs to improve his strategy. And so I can envision this future where data on specific Chess and Go players becomes extremely valuable, because you can use that data to create specific models of how these particular players play.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So increasingly human like behavior and bots, however, as you've mentioned, makes cheating. Cheat detection much harder.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"It does Yeah, the way that cheat detection works. In a game like poker and a game like chess and go from what I understand is trying to see like is this person making moves that are very common among chess AIS, or, you know, AIS in general, but very uncommon among top human players. And if you have the development of these AIs that play in a very strong style, but also very human lifestyle, then that poses serious challenges for cheat detection.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And it makes, you know, ask yourself hard question about what is the role of AI systems as they become more and more integrated in our society. And this kind of human AI? Integration has has some deep ethical issues that we should be aware of. And also, it's a kind of cybersecurity challenge, right? For to make, you know, one of the assumptions we have when we play games, is that there's a trust that it's only humans involved. And they're the better AI systems to create, which makes it super exciting human like AI systems with different styles of humans is really exciting. But then we have to have the defense's better and better and better if we're to trust that we can enjoy human versus human game in a deeply fair way. It's fascinating. It's just, it's humbling.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, I think there's a lot of like negative potential for this kind of technology. But, you know, at the same time, there's a lot of upside for it as well. So, you know, for example, right now, it's really hard to learn how to get better in games like chess and poker and go because the way that the AI plays is so foreign and incomprehensible. Yeah. But if you have these AIs that are playing, you know, you can say like, oh, I'm at 2000, Ehlo. Human, how do I get to 2200? Now you can have an AI that plays in the style of a 2200 Ehlo. Human, and that will help you get better. Or, you know, you mentioned this problem of like, how do you know that you're actually playing with humans when you're playing like online and video games? Well, now we have the potential of populating these, like virtual worlds with agents, like AI agents that are actually fun to play with, and you don't have to always be playing with other humans to, you know, have a fun time. So, yeah, a lot, a lot of upside potential to and I think, you know, with any sort of tool, there's there's the potential for a lot of greatness and a lot of downsides as well.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,"There's some things that we've already talked about, I think, specific to diplomacy. You know, there's there's also the, the challenge that the game is, you know, there is a deception aspect of the game. And so, you know, how developing language models that are capable of deception is, I think, a dicey issue and something that, you know, makes research on diplomacy particularly challenging. And, you know, so those kinds of issues of like, should we even be developing ais that are capable of lying to people, that's something that we have to, you know, think carefully about?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So cool. I mean, that you have to do that kind of stuff in order to figure out where the ethical lines are, but I can see in the future it being illegal to have a consumer product that lies. Yeah. Like your personal assistant AI systems not allowed is always have to tell the truth. But if I asked him, Do I Do I look, did I get fatter over the past month? I sure as hell want that AI system to lie to me. So there's a trade off between lying and being and being nice. We have to somehow find the ethics in that and we're back to discussions inside of relationships. Anyway, what were you saying?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I was like, yeah, there's Yeah, that's kind of going to the question of like, what is a lot, you know, as a white lie, a bad lie is an ethical lie. You know, those kinds of questions.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Boy, we return time and time, again, to deep human questions as we design AI systems. And that's exactly what they do. They put a mirror to humanity. To help us understand ourselves.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"There's, there's also the issue of like, you know, in these diplomacy experiments in order to do a fair comparison, you know, what, what we found is that there's an inherent anti AI bias in these kinds of games. So we actually played a tournaments in a non language version of the game, where, you know, we told the participants like, hey, in every single game, there's going to be an AI. And what we found is that the humans would spend basically the entire game like trying to figure out who the bot was. And then as soon as they thought they figured it out, they would all team up and try to kill it. And, you know, overcoming that inherent anti AI bias is a challenge.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"On the flip side, I think, when robots become the enemy, that's when we get to heal our human divisions, and then we can become one. As long as we have one enemy. It's that Reagan thing when aliens show up, that's when we will put our side our divisions will become one, one human species,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Lex Fridman,"the robots. No, no, no, I think there will be actually in the future, something like a civil rights movement for robots. I think that's the fascinating thing about AI systems is they ask, they force us to ask about ethical questions about what is sentience? What is? How do we feel about systems that are capable of suffering that we're capable of displaying suffering? And how do we design products that show emotion and not? How do we feel about that lying is another topic? Are we going to allow bots to lie or not? And where's the balance between being nice and and telling the truth? I mean, these are all fascinating human questions. And it's like, so exciting to be in the century, we would create systems that take these philosophical questions that have been asked for centuries, and now can engineer them inside systems, or like, you really have to answer them because you'll have transformational impact on human society, depending on what you design inside those systems. That's fascinating. And like you said, I feel like diplomacy is a step towards the direction of the real world, applying these RL methods towards the real world. From from from all the breakthrough performances, and go and chess and Starcraft and Dota This is This feels like the real world. Especially now my mind's been on war, and military conflict. This feels like it can give us some deep insights about human behavior at the large geopolitical scale. What do you think? Is the breakthrough, or the directions of work that will take us towards solving intelligence towards creating AGI systems. You've been a part of creating, by the way, we should say part of great teams that do this, of creating systems that achieve breakthrough performances and before thought, unsolvable problems like poker, multiplayer poker diplomacy, we're taking steps towards that direction, what do you think it takes to go all the way to create superhuman level intelligence?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"You know, there's a lot of people trying to figure that out right now. And, you know, I should say, like, the amount of progress that's been made, especially in the past few years, is truly phenomenal. I mean, you look at where AI was 10 years ago, and the idea that you can have AI is that can generate language and generate images, the way they're doing today, and able to play a game like diplomacy was just like unthinkable even even five years ago, let alone 10 years ago. Now, there are aspects of AI that I think are still lacking. I think there's general agreements, that one of the major issues with AI today is that it's very data inefficient, it's very, it requires a huge number of samples of training examples, to be able to train, you know, you look at an AI that plays go, and it needs millions of games of go to, to learn how to play the game. Well, whereas a human can pick it up. And like, you know, I don't know, how many games is a human Go player, go go Grandmaster play in their lifetime, probably, you know, in the 1000s, or 10s, of 1000s, I guess. So that's, that's one issue over here, efficiency, overcoming this challenge of data efficiency. And this is particularly important if we want to deploy AI systems in real world settings, where they're interacting with humans, because you know, for example, with robotics, it's really hard to generate a huge number of samples. It's a different story, when you're working in these, you know, totally virtual games where you can play a million games, and it's no big deal. I",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"was planning on just launching, like, 1000 of these robots and Austin, I don't think it's illegal for legged robots to roam the streets and just collect data. That's not the worst that could happen.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah. I kind of mean, that's one way to overcome the data efficiency problem. So like, scale it Yeah.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I actually tried to see if there's a law against robots, like legged robots just operating in the, in the streets of a major city. And there isn't, I couldn't find any. So I'll take it all the way to the Supreme Court. Robot rights. Okay. Anyway, sorry, you were saying? So. So what what are the ideas are getting becoming more data efficient?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I mean, that's, that's the trillion dollar question. And AI today, I mean, if you can figure out how to make AI systems more more data efficient, then that's a huge breakthrough. So nobody really knows right? Now, it could",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"be just a gigantic background model language model. And then you do, the training becomes like prompting that model to, to essentially do a kind of coring a search into the space of the things it's learned to customize that to whatever problem you're trying to solve. So maybe if you form a large enough language model, you can go quite quite a long way.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"That, you know, I think there's some truth to that. I mean, if you look at the way humans approach, a game like poker, they're not coming at it from scratch, they're coming at it with a huge amount of background knowledge about, you know, how humans work how the world works, the idea of money. So if they're able to leverage that kind of information to, to pick up the game faster. So it's not really a fair comparison to then compare it to an AI that's like learning from scratch. And maybe one of the ways that we address this sample complexity problem is by allowing AIS to leverage that general knowledge across a ton of different domains.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So like I said, you did a lot of incredible work in a space of research, and actually building systems, what advice would you give to? Let's start with beginners? What advice would you give to beginners interested in machine learning? Just there at the very start of their journey, they're in high school and college, thinking like, this seems like a fascinating world. What advice would you give them?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Um, I would say that there are a lot of people working on similar aspects of machine learning and to not be afraid to try something a bit difference in my own path in AI, is pretty atypical for machine learning researcher today. I mean, I started out working on game theory and and then shifting more towards reinforcement learning as time went on. And that actually had a lot of benefits, I think, because it allowed me to look at these problems in a very different way from the way a lot of machine learning researchers view it. And that comes with drawbacks in some respects. Like I think there's definitely aspects of machine learning thing where, you know, I'm weaker than most of the researchers out there. But I think that diversity of perspective, you know, when I'm working with my teammates, there's something that I'm bringing to the table and something that they're bringing to the table. And that kind of collaboration becomes very fruitful for that reason.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Lex Fridman,"as a beginner so that I would say that's, that's more for like a grad student, where they already built up a base like a complete beginner, what's a good journey? So for you that was doing some more on the math side of things do game theory, or like so it's basically build up a foundation in something so programming mathematics, given the physics, but Bill, build that foundation?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, I would say build a strong foundation in math and computer science and statistics and these kinds of areas, but but don't be afraid to try something that's different and learn something that's different from you know, the, the thing that everybody else is doing to get into machine learning. You know, there's there's value in having a different background than everybody else. Yeah, so. But certainly having a strong math background, especially in things like linear algebra, and statistics and probability, are incredibly helpful today for for learning about and understanding machine learning.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,"Well, what is it like in poker and diplomacy, you need a value function, you need to have a reward system. And so what does it mean to live a life that's optimal?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So okay, so then you can exactly like, lay down a reward function being like, I want to be rich, or I want to be I want to be in a happy relationship. And then you'll say, Well, do X.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"You know, there's, there's a lot of talk today about in AI safety circles about like, Miss specification of, you know, reward function. So you, you say like, okay, my objective is to be rich, and maybe the AI tells you like, Okay, well, if you want to maximize the probability that you're rich, go rob a bank. Sure. And so you want to, is that? Is that really what you want? Is your objective really to be rich at all costs? Or is it more nuanced than that? So",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"the unintended consequences? Yeah. Yeah, so maybe, that's, maybe life is more about defining the reward function that minimizes the unintended consequences, then it is about the actual policy that gets you to the reward function. Maybe life is just about constantly updating the reward function.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I think one of the challenges in life is figuring out exactly what that reward function is, sometimes, it's pretty hard to specify the same way that you know, trying to handcraft the optimal policy in a game like chess is really difficult. It's not so clear cut what the reward function is for for life.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
