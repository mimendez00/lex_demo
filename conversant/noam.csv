Noam Brown,"A lot of people were saying like, Oh, this whole idea of game theory, it's just nonsense.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And if you really want to make money you got to like look into the other person's eyes and read their soul and figure out what cards they have.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But what happened was where we played our bot against four top heads up no limit Hold'em poker players, and the bot wasn't trying to adapt to them.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,It wasn't trying to exploit them.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"It wasn't trying to do these mind games, it was just trying to approximate the Nash equilibrium, and it crushed them.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"The following is a conversation with Noah Brown, research scientist at fair Facebook AI research group at meta AI.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,He co created the first AI system that achieved superhuman level performance.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,In No Limit Texas Hold'em both heads up and multiplayer.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And now recently, he co created an AI system that can strategically out negotiate humans using natural language in a popular board game called diplomacy, which is a war game that emphasizes negotiation.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"This is the LEX Friedman podcast to support it, please check out our sponsors in the description.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And now, dear friends, here's Noam Brown.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,You've been a lead on three amazing AI projects.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So we got libres that solved or at least achieved human level performance on No Limit Texas Hold'em poker with two players heads up.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,You got Pluribus that solved No Limit Texas Hold'em poker with six players.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And just now you have Cicero these are all names of systems that solved or achieved human level performance on the game of diplomacy, which for people who don't know, is a popular strategy board game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"It was loved by JFK, John F. Kennedy and Henry Kissinger and many other big famous people in the decades since so let's talk about poker and diplomacy today.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,First poker what is the game of No Limit Texas Hold'em?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And How's it different from chess?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Well, No Limit Texas Hold'em poker is the most popular variant of poker in the world.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So you know you go to a casino you play sit down at the poker table, the game that you're playing is No Limit Texas Hold'em.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"If you watch movies about poker, like Casino Royale, or Rounders, the game that they're playing is No Limit Texas Hold'em poker.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Now it's very different from limit Hold'em.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And you can bet any amount of chips that you want.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so the stakes escalate really quickly, you start out with like one or $2 in the pot.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And then by the end of the hand, you've got like $1,000 in there, maybe",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"two, the option to increase the number very aggressively, very quickly is always there,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,right?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,The no limit aspect is there's no limit to how much you can bet.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"You know, you can limit Hold'em, there's like $2 in the pot, you can only bet like $2.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But if you got $10,000 in front of you, you're always welcome to put $10,000 into the pot.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So I've had a chance to hang out with Phil Hellmuth, who plays all these different variants of poker.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like no limit rewards crazy.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"versus the other ones rewards more kind of calculated strategy, or no, because you're sort of looking from an from an analytic perspective is is strategy also rewarded.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,In No Limit Texas Hold'em.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I think both variants reward strategy.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But I think what's different about no limit Hold'em is it's it's much easier to get jumpy, you know, you go in there thinking you're going to lose, you're going to play for like $100 or something.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And suddenly, there's like, you know, $1,000 in the pot, a lot of people can't handle that.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Can you define jumping, when you're playing poker, you always want to choose the action that's going to maximize your expected value.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"It's kind of like kind of like with investing, right?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Like, if you're ever in a situation where you're, the amount of money that's at stake is is going to have a material impact on your life, then you're going to play in a more risk averse style.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"You know, if somebody makes a huge bet, you're going to if you're playing No Limit Hold'em, and somebody makes a huge bet, there might come a point where you're like, This is too much money for me to handle like I can't risk this amount.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And that's what throws a lot of people off.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So that's the big difference, I think, between no limit and limit.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,What about on the action side when you're actually making that big bet?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,That's what I mean by crazy.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I was trying to refer to the technical, the technical term of crazy meaning, use the big jump in the bet to completely throw off the other person in terms of their ability to reason optimally.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I think that's right.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I think one of the key strategies in poker is to put the other person into an uncomfortable position.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And if you're doing that, then you're you're playing poker well, and there's a lot of opportunities to do that.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And no limit Hold'em.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"You know, you can have like $50 in there, you throw in $1,000 bet.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And you know that sometimes if you do it right, it puts the other person in a really tough spot.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, it's also possible that you make huge mistakes that way.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And so it's really easy to lose a lot of money and no limit Hold'em.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,If you don't know what you're doing Mmm.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,But there's a lot of upside potential to,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"so when you build systems AI systems that play these games, we'll talk about poker, we'll talk about diplomacy.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Are you?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Are you drawn in, in part by the beauty of the game itself AI aside, or is it to you primarily a fascinating problem set for the AI to solve?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I'm joined by the beauty of the game when I, I started playing poker when I was in high school.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And the idea to me that there is a correct and objectively correct way of playing poker.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And if you could figure out what that is, then you're, you know, you're making unlimited money, basically.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,That's like a really fascinating concept to me.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so I was fascinated by the strategy of poker, even when I was like, 16 years old.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,It wasn't until much later that I actually worked on poker API's.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So there was a sense that you can solve poker, like, in a way you can solve chess, for example, checkers.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I believe checkers got solved, right?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,You think,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"checkers, checkers is completely solved optimal, optimal strategy, it's impossible to beat the AI.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And so in that same way, you could technically solve chess,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"you could solve chess, you could solve poker, you could solve poker.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So this is this gets into the concept of a Nash equilibrium.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So it,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,is a Nash equilibrium.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Okay.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"in any finite two player zero sum game, there is an optimal strategy, that if you play it, you are guaranteed to not lose an expectation no matter what your opponent does.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And this is kind of a radical concept to a lot of people.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But it's true in chess, it's true in poker, it's true in any finite two player zero sum game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And to get some intuition for this, you can think of Rock Paper, scissors, and Rock Paper, Scissors.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"If you randomly choose between throwing rock, paper and scissors with equal probability, then no matter what your opponent does, you're not going to lose an expectation, you're not going to lose an expectation in the long run.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, the same is true for poker, there exists some strategy, some really complicated strategy, that if you play that you are guaranteed to not lose money in the long run.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And I should say, this is for two player poker six player poker is a different story.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, it's a beautiful, giant mess.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"When you say in expectation, you're guaranteed not to lose in expectation, what does an expectation mean?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,pokers a very high variance game.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So you're going to have hands where you win, you're going to have hands with your lose, even if you're playing the perfect strategy, you can't guarantee they're gonna win every single hand.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But if you play for long enough, then you're guaranteed to at least breakeven, and in practice, probably one.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So that's an expectation, the size of your stack, generally speaking.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Now, that doesn't include anything about the fact that you can go broke, it doesn't include any of those kinds of normal real world limitations, you're talking in a in a theoretical world.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"What about the the zero sum aspect, how big of a constraint is that how big of a constraint is finite?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So finite, it's not a huge constraint.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So I mean, most games that you play are finite in size.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"It's also true actually, that there exists this like perfect strategy in many infinite games as well, technically, the game has to be compact.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,There are like some edge cases where you don't have a Nash equilibrium in a two player zero sum game.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So you can think of a game where you like, you know, for playing a game where whoever names, the bigger number is the winner, there's no Nash equilibrium to that game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"1718,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"but you'd be the one again, you're good at this, played a lot of games.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Okay, so that's, and then the zero sum aspect, the 00 sum",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,aspects.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So there exists a Nash equilibrium in non two player zero sum games as well.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And by the way, just to clarify what I mean by two player zero sum, I mean, there's two players, and whatever one player wins, the other player loses.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So if you're playing poker, and I went $50, that means that you're losing $50.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, outside of two player zero sum games, there still exist Nash equilibria.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,But they're not as meaningful.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Because you know, you can think of a game like risk.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,If everybody else at the on the board decides to team up against you and take you out.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"There's no perfect strategy you can play that's going to guarantee that you win, there is nothing you can do.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So outside of two player zero sum games, there's no guarantee that you're going to win by playing a Nash equilibrium.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Have you ever tried to model in the other aspects of the game, which is like the pleasure you draw from playing the game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And then if you're a professional poker player, if you're exciting, even if you lose, the, you know, the money you would get from the attention you get to the sponsor, and all that kind of stuff, is that that'd be a fun thing to model to model in areas that make it sort of super complex to include the human factor.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And this is full complexity.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I think you bring up a couple of good points there.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So I think a lot of professional poker players I mean, they get a huge amount of money not from the actually playing poker but from the sponsorships and having a personality that people want to tune in and watch that.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"That's a big, that's a big way to make a name for yourself in poker.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I just wonder from an AI perspective, if you create and we'll talk about this more, maybe it AI says Some that also talks trash and all that kind of stuff, that that becomes part of the function to maximize.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So it's not just optimal poker play.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Maybe sometimes you want to be chaotic, maybe sometimes you want to be suboptimal, you lose the chaos.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And maybe sometimes you want to be overly aggressive.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Because the audience loves that.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, say,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I think I think what you're getting at here is that there's a difference between making an AI that wins a game and an AI.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,That's fun to play with.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And fun,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,to watch.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So those are all different things fun to play with, and fun to watch.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, and I",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"think, you know, I've, I've heard talks from like game designers, and they say, like, you know, people that work on AI for actual recreational games that people play.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And they say, yeah, there's a big difference between trying to make an AI that actually wins, and you look at a game like civilization.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,The way that the AIS play is not optimal for trying to win.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"They're, they're playing a different game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"They're trying to have personalities, they're trying to be fun and engaging.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And that makes for a better game.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And we also talked about NPCs.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I just talked to Todd Howard, who is the creator of Fallout and the Elder Scrolls series and Starfield, the new game coming out.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And the Creator what I think is the greatest game of all time, which is Skyrim.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And the NPCs.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"There, the AI that governs that whole game is very interesting, but the NPC is also super interesting.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And considering what language models might do, to NPCs in an open world, RPG role playing game is super exciting.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, honestly, um, I think this is like one of the first applications where we're going to see like real consumer interaction with large language models.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I guess like Elder Scrolls six is in development.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Now.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"They're probably like, pretty close to finishing it.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But I would not be surprised at all, if Elder Scrolls seven was using large language models for their NP.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,There.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I mean, I'm not saying anything, saying anything.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Me speculating, not you know what, but there's, they're just releasing the stuff feel good.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,They do one game at a time.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And so whatever it is, whenever the data is, I don't know what the date is calm down.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"But it would be I don't know, like 2024 2526.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So it's actually very possible that would include language models.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I was listening to this, this talk by a gaming executive when I was in grad school.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And one of the questions that the person in the audience asked is, why are all these games so focused on fighting and killing, and the person responded that it's just so much harder to make an AI that can talk with you and cooperate with you than it is to make an AI that can fight you.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And I think once this technology develops further, and you can have, you can reach a point where like, not every single line of dialogue has to be scripted, it unlocks a lot of potential for new kinds of games, like much more like positive interactions that are not so focused on fighting, I'm really looking forward to that",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,might not be positive might be just drama.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So you'll be in that like a Call of Duty game, instead of doing the shooting, you'll just be hanging out.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And like arguing with an AI about like, like passive aggressive, and then you won't be able to sleep that night, you have to return continue the argument that you were emotionally hurt.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I mean, yeah, I think that's actually an exciting world, whatever, whatever is the drama, the chaos, that we love, the push and pull of human connection, I think it's possible to do that in the video game world.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And I think you could be messier and make more mistakes in the video game world, which is why it'd be a nice place.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And also, it doesn't have a deep have as deep of a real psychological impact.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Because inside video games, it's kind of understood that urine is not a real world.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So whatever crazy stuff AI does, we have some flexibility to play.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Just like with a game of diplomacy, it's a game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"This is not real geopolitics, not real war, it's, it's a game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So you can you can have a little bit of fun.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,A little bit of chaos.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Okay, back to how do we find the Nash equilibrium?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Alright, so there's different ways to find an equilibrium.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So the way that we do it is with this process called self play.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Basically, we have this algorithm that starts by playing totally randomly, and it learns how to play the game by playing against itself.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So it will start playing the game totally randomly.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And then, you know, if it's playing poker, it'll eventually like, get to the end of the end of the game and make $50.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And then it will like review all the decisions that I've made along the way, and say, What would have happened if I had chosen this other action instead?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"You know, if I had raised here instead of called, what would the other player have done?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And because it's playing against a copy of itself, it's able to do that counterfactual reasoning, so they can say, Okay, well, if I took this action, and the other person takes this action, and then I take this action, and eventually I make $150 instead of 50.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And so it updates the regret value for that action.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Regret is basically like how much does it regret having not played that action in the past?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And when it encounters that same situation, again, it's going to pick actions that have higher regret with higher probability.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, it'll just keep simulating the games this way, it'll keep, you know, accumulating regrets for different situations.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And in the long run, if you pick actions that have high regret, with higher probability in the correct way, it's proven to converge to a Nash equilibrium.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Lex Fridman,"So this is the method of counterfactual regret minimization, this is counterfactual regret minimization that doesn't have to do with self play has to do with just any, if you follow this kind of process of play or not, you will be able to arrive at an optimal set of actions.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So this counterfactual, regret minimization is a kind of self play.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"It's a principle kind of self play, that's proven to converge to Nash equilibria.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,Sure.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I kind of in my brain, the word self play has mapped in neural networks, but we're speaking something bigger than just the one that works.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,It could be anything.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,If the self playing mechanism is just the mechanism of a system playing itself.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Exactly.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,Okay.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And I would also say, this process of like, trying to reason oh, what would the value had been if I had taken this other action instead?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"This is very similar to how humans learn to play a game like poker, right?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Like you probably played poker before and with your friends, you probably asked like, Oh, what do you have called me if I raise their you know, and that's, that's a person trying to do the same kind of like learning from a counterfactual that the AI is doing.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Lex Fridman,"10 To the one six to one, you said,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, I mean, it depends on the number of chips that you have the stacks and everything, but like the version that we were playing was 10 to the 161,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,which I assume would be a somewhat simplified version anyway.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Because the about there's some like step function you had for like bets.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Oh, no, no, that's, that's I'm saying, like, we played the full game, you can bet whatever amount you want.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,"Yeah,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I mean, 161 plus or minus 10, doesn't matter.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so the the way neural nets help out here is, you know, you don't have to run into the same exact situation, because that's never gonna happen.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Again, the odds of you running into the same exact situation are pretty slim.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But if you run into a similar situation, then you can generalize from other states that you've been in that kind of looked like that one.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,"do, you know?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,That is a controversial question.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Okay, I'm gonna post like",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,somebody screaming on Reddit right now depends on which subreddit you're on Chester's poker.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I'm sure like David Silva is gonna get really angry at me.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I'll say I'm gonna say poker actually.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And I think for a couple reasons.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,They're not,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,here to defend themselves.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"first of all, you have the imperfect information aspects.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so it's that we can go into that, but like, once you introduce imperfect information, things get much more complicated.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So we should say, maybe you can describe what is seen to the players what is not seen in the game of Texas Hold'em.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So Texas Hold'em you get two cards facedown, that only you see.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And so that's the hidden information of the game.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,The other players also all get two cards facedown that only they see.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so you have to kind of as you're playing reason about like, Okay, what did they think I have?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,What do they have?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,What do they think?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I think they have that kind of stuff.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And that's, that's kind of where bluffing comes into play.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Right?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Because the fact that you can bluff.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,The fact that you can bet with a bad hand and still win is because they don't know what your cards are.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Right?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And that's the that's the key difference between a perfect information game like poker, sorry, like Chess and Go, and imperfect information games like poker.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,This is,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,what trash talk looks like.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,The implies statement is the game I saw this much tougher.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"But yeah, so when you're playing, I'm just gonna do random questions here.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So would when you're playing your opponent under imperfect information, is there some degree to which you're trying to estimate the range of hands that they have?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,For Is that not part of the algo?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So what are the different approaches to the imperfect information game?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So the key thing to understand about why imperfect information makes things difficult is that you have to worry not just about which actions to play, but the probability that you're going to play those actions.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So you think about Rock Paper, Scissors, for example, Rock Paper, Scissors is an imperfect information game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Right?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Because you don't know what I'm about to throw.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,I do.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"But yeah, usually not Yeah.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so you can't just say like, I'm just gonna throw a rock every single time because the other person is going to figure that out and notice a pattern, and then suddenly, you're gonna start losing.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so you don't just have to figure out like which action to play, you have to figure out the probability that you play it.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And really importantly, the value of an action depends on the probability that you're going to play it.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So if you're playing rock every single time, that value is really low.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But if you're never playing rock, he played Rock Lake 1% of the time, and suddenly, the, the other person is probably gonna be throwing scissors.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And when you throw a rock, the value of that action is gonna be really high.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now you think that's a poker, what that means is the value of bluffing for example, if you're the kind of person that never bluffs and you have this reputation as somebody that never bluffs, and suddenly you bluff, there's a really good chance that that Bluff is going to work, and you're going to make a lot of money.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"On the other hand, if you've got a reputation, like if they seen you play for a long time, and they see oh, you're the kind of person that's bluffing all the time, when you bluff, they're not going to buy it, and they're going to call you down, you're gonna lose a lot of money.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And that, finding that balance of how often you should be bluffing is the key challenge of a game of poker.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And you contrast that with a game like chess, it doesn't matter if you're opening with the Queens Gambit, 10% of the time, or 100% of time, the value, the expected value is the same.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So So that's, that's why we need these algorithms that understand, not just we have to figure out what actions are good, but the probabilities, we need to get the exact probabilities.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Correct.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And that's actually when we created the bottler brought us the broadest means balanced, because the algorithm that we designed, was designed to find that right balance of how often it should play each action, the balance",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,of how often in the key sort of branching is the bluff or not the bluff.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Is that a is that a good crude simplification of the major decision in poker?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,It's a good simplification.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I think that's like the main tension.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But it's, it's not just how often to bluff or not to bluff.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"It's like, How often should you bet in general, how often should you what, what kind of bet should you make?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Should you bet big or should you bet small win with which was with which hands.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And so this is where the idea of a range comes from.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Because when you're bluffing with a particular hand in a particular spot, you don't want there to be a pattern for the other person to pick up on, you don't want them to figure out, oh, whenever this person is in this spot, they're always bluffing.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so you have to reason about, okay, would I also bet with a good hand in this spot?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,You want to be unpredictable?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So you have to think about, what would I do if I had this different set of cards?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Is there explicit estimation of like a theory of mind that the other person has about you?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Or is that just a emergent thing that happens?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,The way that the bots handle it that are really successful?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,They have an explicit theory of mine.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So they're explicitly reasoning about what are?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"What's the common knowledge, belief?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"What is What do you think I have with you, I think you have, what do you think I think you have, it's explicitly reasoning about those",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,there are multiple use there.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So maybe that's jumping at the six players, but is there a stickiness to the person?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So it's an iterative game, you're playing the same person?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"There is there's a stickiness to that, right?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,You're gathering information as you play?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"It's not every, every, every hand is in your hand.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Is there a continuation in terms of estimating what kind of player I'm facing here?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,That's a good question.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So you could approach the game that way, the way that the bots do it, they don't and the way that humans approach it also expert human players, the way they approach it, is to basically assume that you know, my strategy.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So I'm going to try to pick a strategy where even if I were to play it for 10,000 hands, and you could figure out exactly what it was, you still wouldn't be able to beat it.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Basically, what that means is I'm trying to approximate the Nash equilibrium, I'm trying to be perfectly balanced, because if if I'm playing the Nash equilibrium, even if you know what my strategy is, like I said, I'm still unbeatable in expectation.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So that's what that's what the bot aims for.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And that's actually what a lot of expert poker players aim for as well to start by playing the Nash equilibrium.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And then maybe if they spot weaknesses in the way you're playing, then they can deviate a little bit to take advantage of that.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,They aim to be unbeatable and expectation.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Okay, so who is the greatest poker player of all time?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And why is it Phil Hellmuth so this is fulfill.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So he's known, at least in part For maybe playing sub optimally, and he still wins a lot.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,It's a bit chaotic.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So maybe, can you speak from an AI perspective about the genius of his madness, or the madness of his genius.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So playing sub optimally playing chaotically as a way to make you hard to pin down about what your strategy is.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So, okay, the thing that I should explain first of all was like Nash equilibrium, it doesn't mean that it's predictable.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,The whole point of it is that you're trying to be unpredictable.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, I think why somebody like Phil Hellmuth might be really successful, is not in being unpredictable, but in being able to take advantage of the other player and figure out where they're being predictable, or guiding the other player into thinking that you have certain weaknesses.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And then and then understanding how they're going to change their behavior.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"They're gonna deviate from a Nash equilibrium style of play, to try to take advantage of those perceived weaknesses, and then counter exploit them.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So you kind of get into the mind games there.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So you think about these heads up poker as a dance between two agents, I guess, are you playing the cards?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Are you playing the player?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So this this gets down to a big argument in the poker community and the academic community for a long time, there was this debate of like, what's called GTO game theory, optimal poker, or exploitative play.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And up until about, like, 2017, when we did the librettist match, I think actually exploitative play had the advantage.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"A lot of people were saying, like, oh, this whole idea of game theory, it's just nonsense.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And if you really want to make money, you got to like look into the other person's eyes and read their soul and figure out what cards they have.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But what happened was people started adopting the game theory, optimal strategy.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And they were making good money.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And they weren't trying to adapt so much the other player, they were just trying to play the Nash equilibrium.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And then what really solidified it, I think, was a little too broad as the librettist match, where we played our bot against four top heads up no limit Hold'em poker players, and the bot wasn't trying to adapt to them.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,It wasn't trying to exploit them.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"It wasn't trying to do these mind games, it was just trying to approximate the Nash equilibrium.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And it crushed them.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And think, you know, it we've replaying for $50 $100 blinds, and over the course of about 120,000 hands, it made close to $2 million and 120,000 Hands 120,000 Hands against humans.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, and this was this was fake money to be clear.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So there was real money at stake there was $200,000.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"First of all,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,all money is fake.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,But that's that's a different conversation.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,We give it meaning.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,It's an it's a it's a phenomena that gets meaning from our complex psychology as a human civilization.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,It's emerging from the collective intelligence of the human species.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"But that's not we mean, you mean like, there's literally you can't, you can't buy stuff with it.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Okay.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Can you actually step back and take me through that?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Competition?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Okay.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So when I was in grad school, there was this thing called the annual computer poker competition, where every year, all the different research labs that were working on AI for poker would get together they would make about they would play them against each other.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And we made a bot that actually won the 2014 competition, the 2016 competition.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so we decided we're going to take this bot build on it, and play against real top professional heads up No Limit Texas Hold'em poker players.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So we invited four of the world's best players in this specialty.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And we challenged them to 120,000 Hands of poker over the course of 20 days.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And we had $200,000 $200,000 in prize money at stake, where it would basically be divided among them, depending on how well they did relative to each other.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So we wanted to have some incentive for them to play their best.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Did you have a confidence 2014 16 That this is even possible?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,How much doubt was there?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"we did a competition actually in 2015, where we also played against professional poker players and the bot lost by a pretty sizable margin, actually.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Now there were some big improvements from 2015 to 2017.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And so,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,can you speak to the improvements this is computational nature is the algorithm the methods it was,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,it was really an algorithmic approach.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,That was the difference.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So 2015, it was much more focused on trying to come up with a strategy upfront, like trying to solve the entire game of poker, like and then just have a lookup table where you're saying, like, Oh, I'm in this situation, what's the strategy?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,The approach that we took in 2017 was much more search based.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"It was trying to say, Okay, well, let me in real time try to compute a much better strategy than what I had pre computed by playing against myself during self play.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,What,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,is the search space for poker?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,What are you searching over?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,What's that look like?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"There's different actions like raising, calling.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,What are the actions?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Is it just the social reactions,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"so In a game like chess, the search is like, Okay, I'm in this chess position.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And I can, like, you know, move these different pieces and see where things end up.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"In poker, what you're searching over is the actions you can take for your hand, the probabilities that you take those actions, and then also the probabilities that you take other actions with other hands that you might have.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And that's kind of like, hard to wrap your head around, like, why are you searching over these, like other hands that you might have, and like trying to figure out what you would do with those hands.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And the idea is, again, you want to, you want to always be balanced and unpredictable.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so if your search algorithm is saying, like, oh, I want to raise with this hand, well, in order to know whether that's a good action, like let's say, it's a bluff, you know, let's say you have a bad hand, and you're saying, like, Oh, I think I should be betting here with this really bad hand and bluffing?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Well, that that's only a good action, if you're also betting with a strong hand.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Otherwise, it's an obvious bluff.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So if your action, in some sense, maximizes your unpredictability, so that action could be mapped by your opponent to a lot of different hands than that's a good action.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Basically, what you want to do is put your opponent into a tough spot.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So you want them to always have some doubt, like, should I call here should I fold here?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And if you are raising in the appropriate balance between bluffs and good hands, then you're putting them into that tough spot?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And so that's what we're trying to do.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"We're always trying to search for a strategy that would put the opponent into a difficult position,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,can you give a metric that you're trying to maximize?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,or minimize?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Does this have to do with the regret thing, or we're talking about in terms of putting your opponent in a maximally tough spot?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, ultimately, what you're trying to maximize is your expected winnings, like your expected value, the amount of money that you're going to walk away from assuming that your opponent was playing optimally in response.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So you're going to assume that your opponent is is also playing, like, as well as possible a Nash equilibrium approach?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Because if they're not, then you're just gonna make more money, right?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Like, anything that deviates, like by definition, the Nash equilibrium is the strategy that does the best and expectation.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so if you're deviating from that, then you're just going to lose money.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And since it's a two player zero sum game, that means you're going to make money.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So there's,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"not an explicit like objective function that maximizes the toughness of the spot they're put in, you're always, this is from like a self play reinforcement learning perspective.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,You're just trying to maximize winnings?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And the rest is implicit.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,That's right.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So we're what we're actually trying to maximize is the expected value given that the opponent is playing optimally in response to us.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now in practice, what that ends up looking like is, it's putting the opponent into difficult situations where there's no obvious decision to be made for the",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,system doesn't know anything about the difficulty of the situation.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Not at all doesn't care.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"All right, in my head was getting excited whenever I was making the other the opponent sweat.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Okay, so your 2015, you didn't do as well.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So what's the journey from that to a system that in your mind could have a chance?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So 2015, we we got we BRB, pretty badly.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And we actually learned a lot from that competition.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And in particular, you know, what became clear to me is that the way that humans were approaching the game was very different from how the bot was approaching the game, the bot would not be doing search, he would just be trying to compute, it would do like months of self play, it would just be playing against itself for months.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But then when it's actually playing the game, he would just act instantly.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And the humans, when they're in a tough spot, they would sit there and think, for sometimes even like five minutes about whether they're going to call or fold a hand.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And it became clear to me that that's, there's there's a good chance that that's what missing, this was missing from our bots.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So I actually did some initial experiments to try to figure out how much of a difference this is actually make.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And the difference was huge,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,as a signal to the human player.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"How long you took think,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I don't know, I'm not saying that there are any timing tells I was saying when the human, like the bot would always act instantly, it wouldn't try to come up with a better strategy in real time, over what it had precomputed during training, whereas the human like they have all this intuition about how to play, but they're also in real time, leveraging their ability to think just to search to plan and coming up with an even better strategy, and then what their intuition would say.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So you're,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,saying that there's you're doing that's what you mean by you doing search?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Also, you have you have a intuition and search on top of that looking for a better solution.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, that's, that's what I mean by search that instead of acting instantly, you know, a neural net usually gives you a response and like 100 milliseconds or something depends on the size of the of the net.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But if you can leverage extra computational resources, you can possibly get a much better outcome.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And we did some experiments in small scale versions of poker.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And what we what we found was that if you do a little bit of search even just a little bit, it was the equivalent of making As your, you know, your pre computed strategy, like you can kind of think of it as your neural net 1000 times bigger, with just a little bit of search.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And it just like blew away all of the research that we had been working on and trying to like, scale up this like pre computed solution.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,It was dwarfed by the benefit that we got from search.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Can you just linger on what you mean by search?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Here, you're searching over a space of actions for your hand?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And for other hands?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,How are you selecting the other hands to search over?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So yeah, randomly,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"no, it's all the other hands that you could have.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So when you're playing No Limit Texas Hold'em, you've got two facedown cards.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And so that's 52 choose to 1326 different combinations.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, that's actually a little bit lower, because there's facelift cards in the middle.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And so you can eliminate those as well.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,But you're looking at like around 1000 different possible hands that you can have.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so when we're doing when the bots doing search, it's thinking explicitly, there are these 1000 different hands that I could have there are these 1000 different hands that you could have?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Let me try to figure out what would be a better strategy than what I've pre computed for these hands and your hands?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Okay, so that search, how do you fuse that with what the neural net is telling you?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Or what the train system is telling you?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, so you kind of like that where the train system comes in is, is the value.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So there's, you only look so far ahead, you look like maybe, you know, one round ahead.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So if you're on the flop, you're looking to the start of the turn.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And at that point, you can use the pre computed solution to figure out what are what's the value here of like, of this strategy?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Is it of a single action, essentially, in that spot, you're getting a value?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Or is it the value of the entire series of actions?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Well, it's kind of both, because you're trying to maximize the value for the hand that you have.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But in the process, in order to maximize the value of the hand that you have.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,You have to figure out what would I be doing with all these other hands as well?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Okay, but are you in the search?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Or was going to the end of the game?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,In libres?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,We did.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So we only use search starting on the turn.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And then we searched all the way to the end of the game,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,to turn the river?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Can we take it?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, there was a terminology,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"yeah, there's four rounds of poker.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So there's the preflop, the flop, the turn and the river.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And so we would start doing search halfway through the game.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now the first half of the game that was all pre computed, it would just act instantly.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And then when it got to the halfway point, then it would always search to the end of the game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now we later improved this, so we didn't have to search all the way to the end of the game, it would actually search, just a few moves ahead.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,But that that came later.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And that drastically reduced the number, the amount of computational resources that we needed.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,But the moves because you can keep betting on top of each other.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,That's what I mean by move.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So like, that's where you don't just get one bet, per turn, or poker, you can have multiple arbitrary number, but it's right,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,right?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I'm trying to think like, I'm going to bet and then what are you going to do in response?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,You're going to raise me Are you going to call?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And then if you raise What should I do?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So it's reasoning about that whole process up until the end of the game?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,In the case of libres?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So for the broadest, what's the most number of rephrases?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Have you ever seen,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,you probably cap out at like five or something.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Because at that point, you're basically all in, you know,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I mean, is there like interesting patterns like that, that you've seen, that the game does, like you will have like Alpha zero doing way more sacrifices than humans usually do?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Is there's something like, the brightness was constantly erasing or something like that even noticed,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,there was there was something really interesting that we observed with libres.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So humans, when they're playing poker, they usually size their bets relative to the size of the pot.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So you know, if the pot has $100 in there, maybe you bet like $75, somewhere around somewhere between like 50 and $100.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And with libres, we gave it the option to basically bet whatever it wanted, it was actually really easy for us to say like, Oh, if you want, you can bet like 10 times the pot, and we didn't think would actually do that.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"It was just like, why not give it the option.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And then during the competition, it actually started doing this.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And by the way, this is like a very last minute decision on our part to add this option.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so we did not read it, we did not think the bot would would do this.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And I was actually kind of worried when it did start to do this, like, oh, is this a problem?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Like humans don't do this, like, is it screwing up?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,But it would put the humans into really difficult spots when it would do that?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Because, you know, you can imagine like you have the second best hand that's possible given the board.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And you're thinking like, Oh, you're in a really great spot here.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And suddenly the bot bets $20,000 into you know, $1,000 pot and and it's basically saying like, I have the best hand or I'm bluffing and you having the second best hand like now you got a really tough choice to make.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so the humans would sometimes think like five or 10 minutes about what Like, what do you do?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Should should I call should I fold?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And when I saw the humans like really struggling with that decision, like, that's when I realized like, oh, actually this is maybe a good thing to do after all.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And of course, the system was a no, that is making, again, like we said that is putting them in a tough spot.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"It's it's, it's just that's part of the optimal the game theory optimal,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"right from the bots perspective, it's just, it's just doing the thing that's going to make it the most money.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And the fact that it's putting the humans in a difficult spot, like that's just, you know, a side effect of that.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And this was I think, the the one thing I mean, there were a few things that the humans walked away from, but this was the, the number one thing that humans walked away from the competition saying, like, we need to start doing this.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And now these over bets, what are called over bets, have become really common in high level poker play.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Have you ever talked to somebody like Dan on the ground about this?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,He seems to be a student of the game.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I did actually have a conversation with Daniel de Granja once.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, I was.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I was visiting the Isle of Man to talk to PokerStars about AI.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And Daniel and Ronnie was there.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,We had dinner together with some other people.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And yeah, he's he was really interested in it.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"He mentioned that he was like, you know, excited about like, learning from these API's.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,He wasn't scared.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,He was excited.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"He was excited and,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,and he all he honestly he wanted to play against the bot.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,He thought he he thought he had a decent chance of beating it.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I think he's, you know, this was like, several years ago, and I think it was like, not as clear to everybody that you know, the AIS were taking over.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I think now people recognize that like, if you're playing against a bot, there's like no chance that you have in a game like poke so",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"consistently, the bots will win.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"The Bots of heads up and in in other variants, too.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So multiple multiple six player, Texas Hold'em, No Limit Texas Hold'em was the bots one.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, that's the case.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So I think there is some debate about like, is it true for every single variant of poker, I think, I think for every single variant of poker, if somebody really put in the effort, they can make an AI that would beat all humans at it.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"We've focused on the most popular variants, so heads up No Limit Texas Hold'em.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And then we follow that up with with six player poker as well, where he managed to make about that beat expert human players.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And I think even there now, it's pretty clear that humans don't stand a chance.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"See, I would",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"love to hook up an AI system that looks at EEG, like how like, actually tries to optimize the toughness of the spot it puts a human in.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I would, I would love to see how different is that from the game theory optimal.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So you try to maximize the heart rate of the human player.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Like the freaking out over a long period of time, I wonder if there's going to be different strategies that emerge that are close in terms of effectiveness, because something tells me you could still be achieve superhuman level performance by just making people sweat.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I feel like that there's a good chance that that is the case.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, if you're able to see like that, it's like it's like a decent proxy for score, right.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And this is actually like the the common poker wisdom when they're taught where they're teaching players before, there are bots.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And they were trying to teach people how to play poker, they would say like, the key to the game is to put your opponent into difficult spots.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"It's a good, a good estimate for if you're making the right decision.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So what else can you say about the fundamental role of search in poker?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And maybe if you can also relate it to chess and go in these games?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,What's the role of search to solving these games?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, I think a lot of people under this is true for the general public.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And I think it's true for the AI community.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,A lot of people underestimate the importance of search for these kinds of gaming results.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,An example of this is TD Gammon that came out in 1992.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,This was the first real instance of a neural net being used in a game AI.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So landmark achievement, it was actually the inspiration for Alpha zero.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And it used search, it used to play search to figure out its next move.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"You got deep blue there, he was very heavily focused on search, looking many, many moves ahead farther than any human could.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And that was key for why it won.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And then even with something like AlphaGo, I mean, AlphaGo is commonly hailed as a landmark achievement for neural nets.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And it is, but there's also this huge component of search Monte Carlo Tree Search to AlphaGo.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,That was key absolutely essential for the AI to be able to be top humans.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I think a good example of this is you look at the latest versions of alpha of AlphaGo.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Like it was called Alpha zero.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And there's this metric called EA low rating where you can compare different humans you can compare bots to humans.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, a top human player is around 3600 kilo, maybe a little bit higher now.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Alpha zero the strongest version is around 5200 kilo by If you take out the search that's being done at test time, and by the way, what I mean by search is the planning ahead, the thinking of like, Oh, if I move my, if I placed this stone here, and then he does this, and then you look like five moves ahead, and you see like what the board state looks like.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,That's what I mean by search.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"If you take out the search, that's done during the game, the ELO rating drops to around 3000.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So even today, what seven years after AlphaGo, if you take out the Monte Carlo Tree Search that's being done, at one playing against the human, the bots are not superhuman, nobody has made a raw neural net, that is superhuman and go,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,that's worth lingering on.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"That's, that's quite profound.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So without search, that just means looking at the next move, and saying, This is the best move.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So having a function that estimates accurately what the best move is,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"that's right, without search.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, and all these bots, they have the what's called a policy network, where it will tell you this is what the neural net thinks is the next best move.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And it's kind of like a the intuition that a human has, you know, the the human looks at the board and, and any go or chess master will be able to tell you like, oh, instantly, here's what I think the right move is.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And the bot is able to do the same thing.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,But just like how a human Grandmaster can make a better decision.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"If they have more time to think when you add on this Monte Carlo Tree Search, the bot is able to make a better decision.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, I mean, of course, a human is doing something like search in their brain, but it's not.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,I hesitate to draw a hard line.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,But it's not like Monte Carlo Tree Search.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,It's more like sequential language model generation.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So it's like a different it's a neural network is doing the searching and wonder what the human brain is doing in terms of searching.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Because you're doing that like computation, humanist computing, they have intuition they've got they have a really strong ability to estimate, you know, amongst the top players of what is good and not position without calculating all the details.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,But they're still doing search in their head was a different kind of search.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Have you ever thought about like, what is the difference between the human the search that the human is performing versus what computers are doing?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I have thought a lot about that.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And I think it's a really important question.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So the AI in alpha and alphas in AlphaGo, or any of these guys, they're all doing Monte Carlo Tree Search, which is a particular kind of search.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And it's actually a symbolic tabular search, it uses the neural net to guided search, but it isn't actually like, full full on neural net.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, that kind of search is very successful in these kinds of like perfect information board games, like chess, and go.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But if you take it to a game like poker, for example, it doesn't work, it can't, it can't understand the concept of hidden information, it doesn't understand the balance that you have to strike between, like the amount that you're raising versus the amount that you're calling.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And in every one of these games, you see a different kind of search.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And the human brain is able to plan for all these different games in a very general way.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, I think that's one thing that we're missing from Ai today.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And I think it's a really important missing piece.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"The ability to plan and reason were generally across a wide variety of different settings,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,in a way where the general reasoning makes you better at each one of the games.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, worse.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So you can kind of think of it as like neural nets today, they'll give you like, transformers, for example, are super general.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But you know, they'll give you it'll output an answer in like, 100 milliseconds.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And if you tell it, like, Oh, you got five minutes to give me a decision, you know, feel free to take more time to make a better decision.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,It's not gonna know what to do with that.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But a human, if you're playing a game like chess, they're gonna give you a very different answer, depending on if you say, Oh, you got 100 milliseconds, or you've got five minutes.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, there.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I mean, that when people have started using red transformers, language models, like the iterative way that does improve the answer, or like showing the work, they've had this kind of idea.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, they got this thing called chain of thought reasoning.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And that's, I think, super promising, right?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, I think and I think it's a good step in the right direction.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I would kind of like, say it's similar to Monte Carlo rollouts in in a game like chess, there's a kind of search that you can do, where you're saying, like, I'm going to roll out my intuition and see like, without really thinking, you know, what are the better decisions I can make farther down the path?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,What would I do if I just acted according to intuition for the next 10 moves?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And that gets you an improvement, but I think that there's much, much richer kinds of of planning that we could do.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So one, the brightest actually beat the poker players.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,What did that feel like?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,What was that?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I mean, actually, on that day, what were you feeling like we nervous?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I mean, poker was one of the games that he thought like is not going to be solvable because it's the human factor.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So at least in the near It is we tell ourselves the human factor so fundamental to the game of poker.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, the librettist competition was super stressful for me.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Also, I mean, I was working on this like, basically continuously for a year leading up to the competition.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I mean, for me, it became like very clear, like, Okay, this is the search technique, this is the approach that we need.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And then I spent a year working on this pretty much like nonstop.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Can we actually get into details?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Like what programming languages is it written in?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"was some interesting implementation details that are like, fun slash painful?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So one of the interesting things about LeBron is, is that we had no idea what the bar was to actually beat top humans.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,We could play against like our prior bots.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And that kind of gives us some sense of like, are we making progress?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Are we going in the right direction, but we had no idea like what the bar actually was.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And so we threw a huge amount of resources at trying to make the strongest bot possible.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So we use C++, it was paralyzed.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"We were using I think, like 1000 CPUs, maybe, maybe more actually.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And, you know, today that sounds like nothing.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But for a grad student back in 2016, that was a huge amount of resources, it was still",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"a lot for even a new grad student today, it's still tough to get, or even to allow yourself to think in that in terms of scale at CMU, at MIT, anything like that?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And, you know, talking about terabytes of memory.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So it was a very paralyzed.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And it had to be very fast, too.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Because the more games that you could simulate, the stronger the bot would be.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So is there some like John Carmack style, like, efficiencies, you have to come up with like, an efficient way to represent a hand, all that kind of stuff,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,there are all sorts of optimizations that I had to make to try to get this thing to run as fast as possible.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"They were like, how do you minimize the latency?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"How do you like, you know, package things together, so that like, you minimize the amount of communication between the different nodes.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"How do you like optimize the algorithm so that you can, you know, try to squeeze out more and more from the game that you're actually playing?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"All these kinds of different decisions that that I, you know, had to make?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Just a fun question, what what Id did you use?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,What?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,For for C++?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I think I used Visual Studio actually.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Okay.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Is that still carried through today?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"vs. Code is what I use today, it",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"seems like it's pretty community basically converged on Okay, cool.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So you got you got this super optimized C++ system?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And then you show up to the deer competition?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Humans versus machine.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"How did it feel throughout the day,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,super stressful.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I mean, I thought going into it that we had like a 5050 chance, because basically, I thought if if they play in a totally normal style, I think will squeak out a win.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,But there's always a chance that they can find some weakness in the bottom.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And if they do, and we're playing, like, for 20 days, 120,000 hands of poker, they have a lot of time to find weaknesses in the system.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And if they do, we're gonna get crushed.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And that's actually what happened in the previous competition.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"The humans, you know, they started out, it wasn't like, they were winning from the start.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,But then they found these weaknesses that they could take advantage of.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And for the next they know, like, 10 days, they were just just crushing the bots stealing money from it,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"what were the weaknesses, the phone, like, maybe over betting was effective, that kind of stuff.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So certain betting strategies worked.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"What they found is Yeah, over betting, like betting certain amounts, the bot would have a lot of trouble dealing with those sizes.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And then also, when the bot got into really difficult all in situations, it wasn't able to because it wasn't doing search, it had to clump different hands together, and it wouldn't, it would treat them identically.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so it wouldn't be able to distinguish, you know, like, having a king high flush versus an ace high flush.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And in some situations, that really matters a lot.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so they could put the bot into those situations, and then the bot would would just bleed money.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Clever humans.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Okay, so I didn't realize it was over 20 days.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So what were the humans like over those 20 days?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And what was the bot like?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So we had set up the competition, you know, like I said, there was $200,000 in prize money.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And they would get paid a fraction of that, depending on how well they did relative to each other.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, so I was kind of hoping that they wouldn't work together to try to find weaknesses in the bot.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But they entered the competition with their like, number one objective being to beat the bot, and they didn't care about like individual glory, they were like, We're all gonna work as a team to try to take down this bot.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so they immediately started comparing notes, what they would do is they would coordinate looking at different parts of the strategy to try to try to you know, find out weaknesses.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And then at the end of the day, we actually sent them a log of all the hands that were played and what cards the bot had on each of those hands.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Oh, yeah, that's good.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,See?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"it was honestly I'm not sure why we did that in retrospect, but I mean, I'm glad we did because we ended up winning anyway.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But that if you've ever played poker before, like that is golden information.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I mean, no Usually when you play poker, you see about a third of the hands to showdown.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And to just hand them all the cards that the bot had on every single hand.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,That was just just a goldmine for them.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so then they would review the hands and try to see like, Okay, could they find patterns in the bot weaknesses?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And could they, then then they would coordinate and study together and try to figure out okay, now, this person is going to explore this part of the strategy for weaknesses, this person is gonna explore this part of the strategy for weaknesses.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"It's a kind of psychological warfare, showing them the hands.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I mean, I'm sure you didn't think of it that way.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,But like doing that means you're confident in the bots abilities went?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Well, that's, that's one way of putting it.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I wasn't super confident.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So, you know, going into, like I said, I think I had like, 5050 odds on us winning the, when we actually when we announced the competition, the poker community decided to gamble on who would win.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And their initial odds against us were like four to one, they, they were really convinced that the humans were going to pull out when the bot ended up winning for three days straight.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And even then, after three days, the betting odds were still just 5050.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And then at that point, it started to look like the humans were coming back.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"They started to like, you know, but but poker is a very high variance game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And I think what happened is like, they thought that they spotted some weaknesses that weren't actually there.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And then around day eight, it was just very clear that they were getting absolutely crushed.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And from that point, for, for a while there, I was super stressed out, thinking like, Oh, my God, the humans are coming back.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And we're just they found weaknesses.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And now we're just gonna lose the whole thing.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But no, it ended up going in the other direction.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And the bot ended up like crushing them in the long run.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"How did it feel at the end, like, as a human being would, as a person who loves appreciates the beauty of the game of poker?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And as the person who appreciates the beauty of AI?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Is there?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Did you feel a certain kind of way, but it",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"felt a lot, a lot of things, man.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I mean, at that point in my life, I had spent five years working on this project.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And it was a huge sense of accomplishment.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I mean, to spend five years working on something and finally see it succeed.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, I wouldn't trade that for anything in the world.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, because it's, that's a real benchmark.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,It's not like getting some percent accuracy in a dataset.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"This is like real, this is real world.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,It's just a game.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"But it's also a game, that means a lot to a lot of people.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And this is humans doing their best to beat the machine.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So this is a real benchmark, unlike anything else.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And I mean, this is, this is what I had been dreaming about, since I was like 16, playing poker, you know, with my friends in high school, the idea that you could find a strategy, you know, approximate the Nash equilibrium, able to beat all the poker players in the world with it, you know, so to actually see that come to fruition and be realized.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"That was, it's kind of magical.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, especially money's on the line, too.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,It's a different it's different than chess.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And that aspect, like people get, that's why you want to look at betting markets, if you want to actually understand what people really think in the same sense poker, it's really high stakes, because it's money.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And to solve that game, that's, that's an amazing accomplishment.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So the leap from that to multi way six player poker, what's, how difficult is that jump?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And what are some interesting differences between heads up poker and, and multi-way Poker?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, so I mentioned, you know, Nash equilibrium in two player zero sum games.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"If you play that strategy, you are guaranteed to not lose an expectation no matter what your opponent does.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, once you go to six player poker, you're no longer playing a two player zero sum game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And so there was a lot of debate among the academic community and among the poker community about how well these techniques would extend beyond just two player heads up poker.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, what I have come to realize is that the techniques actually I thought really would extend to six player poker because even though in theory, they don't give you these guarantees, as a two player zero sum games, in practice, it still gives you a really strong strategy.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, there were a lot of complications that would come up with six player poker besides like the game theoretic aspects, I mean, for one, the game is just exponentially larger.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So the main thing that allowed us to go from two player to six player was the idea of depth limited search.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So I said before, like, you know, we would do search, we would plan out, the ball would plan out, like what it's going to do next, and for the next several moves, and in the broadest that search was done, extending all the way to the end of the game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So we'd have to start it from from the turn onwards, like looking maybe 10 moves ahead, it would have to figure out what it was doing for all those moves.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, when you get to six player poker, it can't do that exhaustive search anymore because the game is just way too large.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But by only having to look a few moves ahead and then stopping there and substituting a value estimate of like, how good is that strategy at that point, then we're able to do a much more scalable form of search.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Is there something cool looking at the paper?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I know, there's something cool in the paper in terms of graphics, a game tree traversal via Monte Carlo,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I think if you go down a bit,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,figure one an example of equilibrium selection problem.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Ooh.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,What do we know about equilibria?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,One is there's multiple players.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So when you go outside of two players, you're a sum.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So a Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies like one strategy for each player, where no player has an incentive to switch to a different strategy.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so you can kind of think of it as like, imagine, you have a game where there's a ring, that's actually the visual here, you got a ring, and the object of the game is to be as far away from the other players as possible.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,There's a Nash equilibrium is for all the players to be spaced equally apart around this ring.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But there's infinitely many different Nash equilibria, right, there's infinitely many ways to space for dots along the ring.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And if every single player independently computes a Nash equilibrium, then there's no guarantee that the joint strategy that they're all playing, is going to result is going to be a Nash equilibrium there, they're just going to be like random dots scattered along this ring, rather than for coordinated dots being equally spaced apart, is it possible",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,to sort of optimally do this kind of selection?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,To do the selection of the equilibria you're chasing?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So is there like a meta problem to be solved here?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So the meta problem is, in some sense, how do you how do you understand the Nash equilibria that the other players are going to play?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And, and even if you do that, again, there's no guarantee that you're going to win.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So you know, if you're playing, if you're playing risk, like I said, and all the other players decide to team up against you, you're gonna lose Nash equilibrium doesn't help you there.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And so there is this big debate about whether Nash equilibrium and all these techniques that compute it are even useful once you go outside a two player zero sum games.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, I think for many games, there is a valid criticism here.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And I think when we talk about when we go to something like diplomacy, we run into this issue that the approach of trying to approximate a Nash equilibrium doesn't really work anymore.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But it turns out that in six player poker, because six player poker is such an adversarial game, where none of the players really try to work with each other.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"The techniques that were used into player poker to try to approximate an equilibrium, those still end up working in practice.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"In six player poker,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"there's some deep way in which six player poker is just a bunch of heads up poker, like games in one.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"It's like, it's like embedded in it.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So the competitiveness is more fundamental to poker than the cooperation,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,right?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, poker is just such an adversarial game, there's no real cooperation.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"In fact, you're not even allowed to cooperate in poker, it's considered collusion.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,It's against the rules.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so for that reason, that techniques end up working really well.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And I think that's true more broadly, in extremely adversarial games in general,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,but that's sort of in practice versus being able to prove something.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,That's right.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Nobody has a proof that that's the case.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And it could be that that six player poker belongs to some class of games, where a approximating a Nash equilibrium through self play provably works well.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And you know, there are other classes of games beyond just two player zero sum where this is proven to work well.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So there are these kinds of games called potential games, which I won't go into.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,It's kind of like a complicated concept.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,But there are classes of games where this approach to approximating a Nash equilibrium is proven to work well.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Now six player poker is not known to belong to one of those classes.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,But it is possible that there is some classic games where it either provably performs well or provably performs not that badly.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So what are some interesting things about Pluribus that was able to achieve human level performance on this, or superhuman level performance on the six player version of poker?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I personally, I think the most interesting interesting thing about Pluribus is that it was so much cheaper than LeBron is, I mean, LeBron is, if you had to put a price tag on the computational resources that went into it.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I would say the final training runs about $100,000.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,You go to Pluribus.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,The final training run would cost like less than $150 on AWS.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Is this normalized to computational inflation?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So meaning, this is Is this just does this just have to do with the fact that Pluribus was trained like a year later?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"No, no, it's not.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"It's I mean, first of all, like Yeah, computing resources are getting cheaper every day and like, but you're not going to see 1000 fold decrease in the computational resources over two years.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,or even anywhere close to that the real improvement was algorithmic improvements.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And in particular, the ability to do depth limited search.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So it does depth limited search also worked for libres.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yep, yes.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So where this depth limited search came from is, you know, I developed this technique and ran it on to player poker first.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And that reduced the computational resources needed to make an AI that was superhuman, from, you know, $100,000, for the Broadus to something you could train on your laptop.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,What do you learn from the from that discovery?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,What I would take away from that is that algorithmic improvements really do matter.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,How would you describe the more general case of limited depth search?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So it's basically constraining the scale a temporal or in some other way of the computation you're doing in some clever way?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So like, with, like, how else can you significantly constrained computation?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Right?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Well, I think the idea is that we want to be able to leverage search as much as possible.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And the way that we were doing it in the broadest required us to search all the way to the end of the game.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, if you're playing a game like chess, the idea that you're gonna search always to the end of the game is kind of unimaginable, right?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Like, there's just so many situations where you just won't be able to use search in that case, or the cost would be, you know, prohibitive.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And this technique allowed us to leverage search, and without having to pay such a huge computational cost for it, and be able to apply it more broadly.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So to what degree did you use neural nets for libres and Pluribus, and more generally, what role Jinyuan that have to play in and superhuman level performance in poker.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So we actually did not use neural nets at all for libres, or Pluribus.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And a lot of people found this surprising back in 2017, I think they find it surprising today that we were able to do this without using any neural nets.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And I think the reason for that, I mean, I think neural nets are incredibly powerful.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And the techniques that are used today, even for poker API's, do rely quite heavily on neural nets.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But it wasn't the main challenge for poker, like I think what neural nets are really good for, if you're in a situation where finding features for a value function is really difficult, then neural nets are really powerful.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And this was the problem and go, right, like the problem and go was that were the final problem and go at least, was that nobody had a good way of looking at a board and figuring out who was winning or losing describing through a simple algorithm who was winning or losing.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so their neural nets were super helpful, because you could just feed in a ton of different board positions into this neural net, and it would be able to predict then who was winning or losing.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But in poker, the features weren't the challenge.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"The challenge was, how do you design a scalable algorithm that would allow you to find this balance strategy?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,That would understand that you have to bluff with the right probability?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So Can that be somehow incorporated into the value function, this the complexity of poker that you've described?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, so the way the value functions work in poker, like the latest and greatest poker API's, they do use neural nets for the value function.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"The way it's done is is very different from how it's done in a game like chess or go because in poker, you have to reason about beliefs.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And so the value of a state depends on the beliefs that players have about what the different cards are.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Like, if you have pocket aces, then whether that's a really, really good hand or just an okay hand, depends on whether you know, I have pocket aces, right?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Like, if you know that I have pocket aces, then if I bet you're going to fold immediately, but if you think that I've a really bad hands, then I could bet with pocket aces and make a ton of money.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So the value function in poker these days, takes the beliefs as an input, which is very different from like how Chess and Go AI's work.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So as a person who appreciates the game?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Who do you think is the greatest poker player of all time?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,That's a That's a tough question.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Can AI help answer that question?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Can you can actually analyze the quality of play, right?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So the chess engines can can give estimates of the quality of play, right?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,I wonder if there's a is there an ELO rating type of system for poker?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I suppose you could, but there's just not enough.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"You would have to play a lot of games, right?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,A very large number of games like more than you would in chess.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,A deterministic game makes it easier to estimate your I think,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I think it is much harder to estimate something like a low rating in poker.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I think it's doable.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,The problem is that the game has very high variance.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So you could play you could be profitable.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Will in poker for a year.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And you could actually be a bad player just because the variance is so high.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I mean, you've got top professional poker players that would lose for a year, just because they're on a really bad, bad streak.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So yeah, so for you, you have to have a nice clean way of saying if player a player B, and a BS B that says something that's a signal in poker is a very noisy signal.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,It's,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,a very noisy signal.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Now there is a signal there.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so you could do this, this calculation, it would just be much harder.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But the same way that AI is have now taken over chess and you know, all the top professional chess players train with with AIs.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"The same is true for poker, the game has become a very computational people train with AI is to try to find out where they're making mistakes, try to learn from the AIS to improve their strategy.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So now, yeah, so the game has been revolutionized in the past five years by by the development of AI in the sport, the",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,skill with which you avoided the question of the greatest of all time was impressive.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So my feeling is that it's a difficult it's a difficult question, because just like in chess, where you can't really compare Magnus Carlsen today to Garry Kasparov.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Because the game has evolved so much.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,The poker players today are so far beyond the skills of like people that were playing even 10 or 20 years ago.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So you look at the kinds of like all stars that were on ESPN, add like the height of the poker, boom.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Pretty much all those players are actually not that good at the game today, at least at least the the strategy aspect, I mean, there's might be still be good at like reading the player at the other side of the table and trying to figure out like, are they bluffing or not.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But in terms of the actual, like, computational strategy of the game, a lot of them have really struggled to keep up with that development.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Now.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So for that reason, I'll give an answer on I'm gonna say Daniel Negreanu, who you actually had on the podcast recently, I saw as a great episode, and I love this.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And Phil's gonna hate this so much.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,Exactly.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And I think a lot of a lot of the old school poker players are just kind of given up on that aspect.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,"Yeah, so I talked a lot about two player zero sum games.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And what's interesting about diplomacy is that it's very different from these like adversarial games like chess, go poker, even Starcraft and Dota.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,"It's a seven player game, it was actually created in the 50s.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And it takes place before World War One, it's like a map of Europe with seven great powers.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And they're all trying to form alliances with each other.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,There's a lot of negotiation going on.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so the whole focus of the game is on forming alliances with the other players to take on the other players,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"England, Germany, Russia, Turkey, Austria, Hungary, Italy, and France.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,That's right.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So the way the game works, is, on each turn, you're spend about, you know, five to 15 minutes talking to the other players in privates.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And you make all sorts of deals with them, you say, like, hey, let's work together.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"You know, let's team up against this other player, because the only way that you can make progress is by working with somebody else against the others.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And then after that negotiation period is done.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"All the players simultaneously submit their moves, and they're all executed at the same time.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so you can tell people like, Hey, I'm going to support you this turn, but then you don't follow through with it.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And they're only going to figure that out.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Once they see the movies being read off.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"How much of it is natural language, like written, actual text, how much is like, you're actually saying phrases that are structured.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So there's different ways to play the game.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,You can play it in person.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And in that case, it's all natural language, freeform communication, there's no constraints on the kinds of deals that you can make the kinds of things that you can discuss.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,You can also play it online.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So you can, you know, send long emails back and forth.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,You can play it like live online or voice chats.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Lex Fridman,"I saw that somebody said online that the internet version of the game has this quality of this easier to almost to do like role playing, as opposed to being yourself, you can actually like, be the like, really imagine yourself as the leader of France, or Russia and so on, like, really pretend to be that person, it's actually fun to really lean into being that that leader?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, so some, some players do go this route, where they just like, kind of view it as a strategy game, but also a role playing game where they can like act out, like, what would I be like if I was, you know, leader of France in 1900",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Forfeit right away?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And they sometimes use like, the old timey language to like, or how they imagined the lease would talk at that time.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Anyway, so the what are the different turns of the game?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Like, what are the rounds?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, so on every turn, you got like, a bunch of different units that you start out with.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So you start out, controlling like, just a few units, and the object of the game is to gain control of the majority of the map, if you're able, if you're able to do that, then you've won the game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But like I said, the only way that you're able to do that is by working with other players.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So on every turn, you can issue a move order.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So for each of your units, you can move them to an adjacent territory, or you can keep them where they are.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Or you can support a move or hold of a different units.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So what are the territories?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Well, how is the map divided up,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"it's kind of like risk where the map is divided up into like, 50 different territories.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, you can enter a territory, if you're moving into that territory with more support than the person that's in there, or the person that's trying to move in there.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So if you're moving in, and then somebody's already there, then if neither of you have support, it's a one versus one, and you'll bounce back, and neither of you will make progress.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"If you have a unit that's supporting that move into the territory, then it's a two versus one, and you'll kick them out, and they'll have to retreat somewhere.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"What a support me support is like, it's an action that you can issue in the game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So you can say, this unit, you write down this unit is supporting this other unit into this territory,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,or these units from opposing forces.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,They could be,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"they could be and this is, this is where the interesting aspect of the game comes in, because you can support your own units into territory.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,But you can also support other people's units into territories.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And so that's what the negotiations really revolve around.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"But you don't have to do the thing you say you're going to do is Yeah, and so that you can say I'm going to support you but then backstabbed the person.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, that's absolutely right.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And that tension is core to the game.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"That tension is absolutely core to the game, the the fact that you can make all sorts of promises, but you have to reason about the fact that like a they might not trust you, if you say you're going to do something, or they might be lying to you, when they say they're going to support you.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So maybe just just to jump back what's what's the history of the game in general?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Is it true that Henry Kissinger love the game?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And JFK and all those that I've heard like a bunch of different people that or is that just one of those things that the cool kids say they do, but they don't actually play?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So the game was created in the 50s.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And from what I understand it was JFK days it was played in like the JFK White House Henry Kissinger's favorite game.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I don't know if it's true, but that's definitely what I've heard.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,It's,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"interesting that they went with World War One, when it was created after World War Two.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So the story that I've heard for the creation of the game is it was created by somebody that had looked at the history of the 20th century, and they saw World War One as a failure of diplomacy.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So sure, you know, they saw the fact that this war broke out as like the diplomats of all these countries like really failed to prevent a war and he wanted to create a game that would basically teach people about diplomacy.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And it's really fascinating that like in his ideal version of the game of diplomacy, nobody actually wins the game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Because the whole point is that if somebody is about to win, then the other players should be able to work together to stop that person from winning.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And so the ideal version of the game is just one where nobody actually wins.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And, you know, it's kind of nice, like, wholesome take home message then that, you know, war war is ultimately futile.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"and that optimal that futile, optimal could be achieved through great diplomacy.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Yep.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So is there some asymmetry in in terms of which is more powerful Russia versus Germany versus France, and so on?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So I think the general consensus is that France is the strongest power in the game.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,But the beautiful thing about diplomacy is that it's self balancing.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Right.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So the fact that France has an inherent advantage from the beginning, means that the other players are less likely to work with it.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So that Russia has four units, verse four, have something that the others have three of something",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,that's true.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So Russia starts off with four units, while they all the other players start with three.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But Russia is also in a much more vulnerable position, because they have to like, they have a lot more neighbors as well.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Larger territory more.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, right.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,More border to defend.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Okay.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"What else is, what else is important to know about the rules?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So they're there?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,How many rounds are there?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Like, is this iterative game is there is is a finite just keep going indefinitely.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Usually, the game lasts, I would say about 15, or 20.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Turns.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"There's, in theory, no limit, it could last longer.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But at some point, I mean, if you're playing a house game with friends, at some point is get tired.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And you all agree like, Okay, we're going to end the game here and call it a draw.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"If you're playing online, there's usually like set limits on when the game will actually end.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And what's the end?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"What's the termination condition like this, this one country have to conquer everything else.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So if somebody is able to actually gain control of a majority of the map, then then they've won the game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And that is a solo victory, as it's called.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, that pretty rarely happens, especially with strong players, because like I said, the game is designed to incentivize the other players to put a stop to that and all work together to stop the superpower.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Usually, what ends up happening is that, you know, all the players agree to withdraw.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And then the score, the win is divided among the remaining players.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"There's a lot of different scoring systems, the one that we used in our research, basically, gives a score relative to how much control you have of the map.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So the more that you control, the higher your score.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,What's the history of using this game as a benchmark for AI research?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,To?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Do people use it?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, so people have been working on AI for diplomacy since about the 80s.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,There was some really exciting research back then.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But the approach that was taken was very different from what we see today, the research in the 80s was a very rule based approach, kind of kind of a heuristic approach is very in line with the kind of research that was being done in the 80s.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"You know, basically trying to encode human knowledge into the strategy of the AI.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Sure.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And, you know, it's understandable, I mean, the game is so incredibly different.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so, so much more complicated than the kinds of games that people working on like chess, and go, and poker that it was honestly even hard to, like, start getting making any progress in diplomacy.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Can you just,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"formulate, what is the problem from an AI perspective?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And why is it hard?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Was it a challenging game to solve?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So there's a lot of aspects in diplomacy that make it a huge challenge.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"First of all, you have the natural language components.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And I think this really is what makes it really the most difficult game among like, the major benchmarks, the fact that you have to it's not about moving pieces on the board.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Your action space is basically all the different sentences that you could communicate to somebody else in his game.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,is there Can we just like linger on that.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So it's part of it, like the ambiguity in language, if it was like, very strict, if you narrow the set of possible sentences, you could do it with that simplify the game significantly.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,The real difficulty is the breadth of things that you can talk about.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"You can have natural language and other games, like Settlers of Catan, for example, you could have a natural language Settlers of Catan AI, but the things that you're going to talk about are basically like, am I treating you to sheep for water, three sheep for wood.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Whereas in a game like diplomacy, the breadth of conversations that you're going to have or like, you know, am I going to support you or are you going to support me in return which units are going to do what's what did this other person sit promise you?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,They're lying because they told this other person that they're going to do this instead.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"If you helped me out this turn, then in the future, I'll do these things that will help you out.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,The the depth and breadth of these conversations is really complex.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,created.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And it's all being done in natural language.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Now you could approach it.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And we actually consider doing this, like, you know, having a simplified language to make this complexity smaller.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But ultimately, we thought, the most impactful way of doing this research would be to help address the natural language component head on, and just try to go for the full game upfront.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Just looking at sample games, and what the conversations look like greetings, England, this should prove to be a fun game, since all the private press is going to be made public at the end.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"At the least, it will be interesting to see if the press changes because of that.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Anyway, good.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Okay.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So there's like,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"yeah, that's just kind of like the generic readings at the beginning of the game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I think that the meat comes a little bit later, when you're starting to talk about like, specific strategy and stuff.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,I agree.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"There are a lot of advantages to the two of us keeping in touch, and our nation's make strong natural allies in the middle game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So that kind of stuff, making friends making enemies.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, right.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Like, if you look at the next line, so the person is saying, like, I've heard bits about a Panto, and an octopus opening and basically telling Austria like, hey, just a heads up.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"You know, I've heard these whispers about like, what might be going on behind your back?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So there's all kinds of complexities in that, in the, in the language of that, right.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Like to interpret what that what that means.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"It's hard for us humans, but for AI, it's even harder, because you have to understand, like, at every level, the semantics of that,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,right.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I mean, there's this is a complexity and understanding when somebody is saying this to me, what does that mean?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And then there's also the complexity of like, should I be telling this person this?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Like, I've overheard these these whispers?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Should I be telling this person that like, Hey, you might be getting attacked by by this other power?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Okay, so what how we're supposed to think about okay, so that's the natural language?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,How do you even begin trying to solve this game?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"It seems like, this seems like the Turing test on steroids.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And I mean, there's, there's the natural language aspect.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And then even besides the natural language aspect, you also have the the cooperative elements of the game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And I think this is actually something that I find really interesting, if you look at all the previous game AI, breakthroughs, they've all happened in these purely adversarial games where you don't actually need to understand how humans play the game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,It's all just AI versus AI.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Right?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Like you look at checkers, chess, go poker, Starcraft Dota.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Two, like in some of those cases, they leveraged human data, but they never needed to, they were always just trying to have a scalable algorithm, that then they could throw a lot of computational resources out a lot of memory out.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And then eventually, it would converge to an approximation of a Nash equilibrium, this perfect strategy, that in a two player zero sum game guarantees that they're going to be able to not lose to any opponents.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So you can leverage self play.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So this game, you",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"you can leverage self play, but it's no longer sufficient to beat humans.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So how do you integrate the human into the loop of this, so what you",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,have to do is incorporate human data.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And to kind of give you some intuition for why this is the case.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Like imagine you're playing a negotiation game like like diplomacy.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,But you're training completely from scratch.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Without any human data that the AI is not going to suddenly like, figure out how to communicate in English, it's going to figure out some weird robot language that only it will understand.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And then when you stick that in a game with six other humans, they're going to think this person is talking gibberish, and they're just going to ally with each other and team up against the bot.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Or not even keep up against the ball, but just not work with the bot.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so in order to be able to play this game with humans, it has to understand the human way of playing the game, not this machine way of playing the game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, that's fascinating.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So right, the nuanced thing to understand because the chess playing program doesn't need to play like a human to beat a human Exactly.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,But here you have to play like a human in order to beat them.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Or at least you have to understand how humans play the game so that you can understand how to work with them.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,If they have certain expectations about what does it mean to be a good ally?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"What does it mean to have like a reciprocal relationship where we're working together, you have to abide by those conventions?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And if you don't, they're just gonna work with somebody else instead.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Do you think of this as a clean in some deep sense of the spirit of the Turing test is formulated by Alan Turing is it is some sense this is what the Turing test actually looks like.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So because of open ended natural language conversation seems like very difficult to evaluate, like here at a high stakes where humans are trying to win a game that seems like how you actually perform the Turing test.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I think it's different from the Turing test, like the way that the Turing test is formulated.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"It's about trying to distinguish a human from a machine and seeing Okay, Did the machine successfully pass as a human in this adversarial setting where the aid where the player is trying to figure out whether it's a machine or human, whereas in diplomacy, it's not about trying to figure out whether this player is a human or machine.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"It's ultimately about whether I can work with this player, regardless of whether they are human or machine.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And can the machine do that better than a human can?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, I'm gonna think about that.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,But that just feels like the implied requirement for that is for the machine to be human.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Like,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I think that's, I think that's true that if you're going to play in this human game, you have to somehow adapt to the, to the human surroundings, and the human playstyle.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And to win, you have to adapt.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So you can't if you're the outsider, if you're not human, like I feel like that's a losing strategy.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I think that's I think that's correct.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So okay.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,What are the complexities here?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,What was your approach to it?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Before I get to that, one thing I should explain, like why we decided to work on diplomacy here.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So basically, what happened is in 2019, I was wrapping up the work on Sixth player poker on Pluribus.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And it was trying to think about what to work on next.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And I had been seeing like all these other breakthroughs happening in AI, I mean, like, 2019, you have StarCraft, you have alphastar, beating humans and StarCraft, you've got the Dota, two stuff happening at open AI, you have GPT, two or DVD three, I think the GPT, two at the time.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And it became clear that AI was progressing really, really rapidly.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And people were throwing out these like other games about, you know, what should be the next challenge for multi agent AI.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And I just felt like we had to aim bigger.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"If you look at a game, like chess, or a game like go, they took decades for researchers to to ultimately reach superhuman performance that I mean, like chess took four years of AI research, go took another 20 years.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And we thought that diplomacy would be this incredibly difficult challenge that could easily take a decade to make an AI that could play competently.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,But we felt like That was that was a goal worth aiming for.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so honestly, I was kind of reluctant to work on it at first, because I thought it was like, too far out of the realm of possibility.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But, you know, I was talking to a co worker of mine, Adam Lear.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And he was basically saying, like, why not aim for it?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"You know, we'll learn some interesting things along the way.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And maybe it'll be possible.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And so we decided to go for it.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And I think I think it was the right choice, considering just how much progress there there was in AI, and that that progress has continued in the years since",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,so winning and diplomacy.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,What does that really look like?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"It means talking to six other players, six other entities, agents, and convincing and convincing them have stuff that you want them to be convinced of?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Like, what exactly I'm trying to get like to deeply understand what the problem is.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Ultimately, the problem is, it's simple to quantify, right?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Like, you're going to play this game with humans, and you want your score on average to be as high as possible.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"You know, if you can say like, I am winning more than any any human alive, then you're a champion diplomacy player.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, ultimately, we haven't we didn't reach that we got to human level performance, we actually, so we played about 40 games with with real humans online.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,The bot came in second of all players that played five or more games.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so not like number one, but way, way higher than what was",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,the expertise level?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Are they beginners?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Are they intermediate players, advanced players?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So in,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"that sense, that's a great question.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So I think this kind of goes into how do you measure the performance in diplomacy.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And I would argue that when you're measuring performance in a game like this, you don't actually want to measure it in games with all expert players.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"It's kind of like if you're developing a self driving car, you don't want to measure that car on the road with a bunch of experts don't traverse Yeah, you want to put it on a road of like an actual American city and see is this car crashing less often than an expert driver would?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So that's the metric that we've used.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"We were saying, like, we're gonna stick this game, we're gonna stick this bot in games with a wide variety of skill levels.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And then are we doing better than a stronger expert human player would in the same situation?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"That's quite brilliant because I played a lot of sports in my life, like as a tennis judo, whatever.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And it's somehow almost easier to go against experts almost always.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,I think they're more predictable in the quality of play.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,The space of strategies you're operating under is narrower against experts.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,It's more fun.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,It's really frustrating against beginners.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Also, because Beginners talk trash to you, when they somehow do beat you says, that's a human thing that they are designed to be worried about that.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"But yeah, the variance in strategies is greater, especially with natural language, it's just all over the place, then.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, and honestly, when you look at what makes a good human diplomacy player, obviously, they're able to handle themselves in games with other expert humans, but where they really shine is when they're playing with these weak players.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And they know how to take advantage of the fact that they're a weak player that they won't be able to like pull off a stab as well, or that they have certain tendencies.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And they can take them under their wing and persuade them to do things that might not even be in their interest.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,They're really good diplomacy players are able to take advantage of the fact that there that there are some weak players in the game.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Okay, so if you have to incorporate human play data, how do you do that?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,How do you do that in order to train an AI system to play diplomacy?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, so that's, that's really the crux of the problem.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"How do we leverage the benefits of self play that have been so successful in all these other previous games, while keeping the strategy as as human compatible as possible.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And so what we did is we first trained a language model.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And then we made that language model controllable.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"On a set of a set of intents, we call intents, which are basically like an action that we want to play, and an action that we would like the other player to play.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so this gives us a way to generate dialogue, that's not just trying to imitate the human style, whatever a human would say, in this situation, but to actually give it a an intent of purpose in its communication, we can talk about a specific move, or we can make a specific request.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And the determination of what that move is that we're discussing comes from strategic strategic reasoning model that uses reinforcement learning and planning.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So the computing the intense for all the players.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,How's that done?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Just as a as a starting point?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Is that with reinforcement learning?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Or is that just optimal?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Determining what the optimal is for intense,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"it's a combination of reinforcement learning and planning, actually very similar to how you approach how we approached poker and how people approached like Chess and Go as well.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"We're using self play, and and search to try to figure out what are what is an optimal move for us, and what is a desirable move that we would like this other player to play?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, the difference between the way that we approached reinforcement learning and search in this game, versus those previous games, is that we have to keep it human compatible, we have to understand how the other person is likely to play rather than just assuming that they're going to play like a machine,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,and how language gets them to play in a way that maximize the chance of following the intent you want them to follow.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Okay, how do you how do you do that?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,How do you?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"How do you connect language to intent,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,so the way that RL and planning is done is actually not using language.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So we're coming up with this like plan for the action that we're gonna play in the other person's gonna play.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And then we feed that action into the dialogue model, that will then send a message according to those plans.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So the language model there is mapping action to message to message, one word at a time.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Basically, one message at a time.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So will will feed into the dialogue model, like here are the actions that you should be discussing, here's the message, here's like the, the contents of the message that we would like you to send, and then it will actually generate a message that corresponds to that, okay, does this actually work?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,It works surprisingly well.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Okay, how?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And the number of ways it probably goes horribly, I would have imagined it goes horribly wrong.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So how the heck is it effective at all?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I mean, there are a lot of ways that this could fail.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So for example, I mean, you could have a situation where you're, you're basically like, we don't tell the the language model, like here are the pieces of our action or the other person's action that you should be communicating.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so like, let's say you're about to attack somebody, you probably don't want to tell them that you're going to attack them.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,But there's nothing in the language like the language model is not very smart at the end of the day.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So it doesn't really have a way of knowing like, well, what should I be talking about?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Should I tell this person that I'm about to attack them or not?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So we have to, like develop a lot of other techniques that that deal with that.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Like one of the things we do, for example, is we try to calculate, if I'm going to send this message, what would I expect the other person to do in response?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So if it's a message like, Hey, I'm going to attack you this turn, they're probably going to, you know, attack us or defend against that attack.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so we have a way of recognizing like, hey, sending this message is a negative expected value action and we should not send this message.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So you have for particular kinds of messages.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,You have like an extra function that does the have estimated the value of that message.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So we have these kinds of filters that like to filter.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So there's a good is that filter on your network?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Or is it rule based?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"That's, that's a neural network.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So we're, well, it's a it's a combination.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"It's a neural network, but it's also using planning.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"It's trying to compute like, what is the policy that the other players are going to play given that this message has been sent?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And then is that better than not sending the message or, or feel like",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"that's how my brain works to like, there's a language model that generates random crap.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And then there's these other neural nets that are essentially filters.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,At least that's when I tweet.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I'll usually my process of tweeting, I'll think of something.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And it's hilarious to me.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And then about five seconds later, the filter network comes in and says, no, no, it's not funny at all.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,That me there's some something interesting to that kind of process.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So you have a set of actions that you you want, you have an intent, the you want to achieve an intent that you want your opponent to achieve the generate messages, and then you evaluate those messages will achieve the the goal you want.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, we're filtering for several things.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"We're filtering, like, is this a sensible message, you know, so sometimes language models will send will generate messages that are just like, totally nonsense.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And we try to filter those out, we also try to filter out messages that that are basically lies.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So, you know, diplomacy has this reputation as a game that's really about deception and lying.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,But we try to actually minimize the amount that the bot would lie.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,This was actually mostly or are,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,you scared?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I mean, like, part of the reason for this is that we actually found that lying, would make the bot perform worse, in the long run, it would end up with a lower score.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Because once the bot lies, people will never trust it again.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And trust is a huge aspect of the game of diplomacy notes,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"here, because I think this is applies to, to life lessons two,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"oh, I think it's a really yeah, really strong.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,like lying is a dangerous thing to do.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Like, you want to avoid obvious lying.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, I mean, I think when people play diplomacy for the first time, they approach it as a game of deception and lying.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And, and they ultimately, if you talk to top diplomacy players, what they'll tell you is that diplomacy is a game about trust, and being able to build trust in an environment that encourages people to not trust anyone.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So that's the ultimate tension in diplomacy.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,How can this AI reason about whether you are being honest in your communication?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And how can the AI persuade you that it is being honest, when it is telling you that, hey, I'm actually going to support you this turn?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Is there some sense I don't know if you step back and think that this process will indirectly help us study human psychology?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So like, if trust is the ultimate goal, would not help us understand what are the fundamental aspects of forming trust between humans and between humans and AI?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I mean, that's a really, really important question that's much bigger than the strategy games is how can this fundamental to the human robot interaction problem?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,How do we form trust between intelligent entities?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So one of the things I'm really excited about with diplomacy, there's never really been a good domain to investigate these kinds of questions.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And diplomacy gives us a domain where trust is really at the center of it.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And it's not just like you've hired a bunch of mechanical Turkers that, you know, are being paid and trying to get through the task as quickly as possible.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"You have these people that are really invested in the outcome of the game, and they're really trying to do the best that they can.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so I'm really excited that we're able to, we actually, like have put together this, we're open sourcing all of our models, we're open sourcing, all of the all the code, and we're making the data that we've used available to researchers, so that they can investigate these kinds of questions.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So the data of the different the human in the eye, AI play of diplomacy, and the models that you use for the generation of the messages and the filtering.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, not not just even the data of the AI playing with the humans, but all the training data that we that we had, that we use to train the AI to understand how humans play the game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"We're setting up a system where researchers will be able to apply to be able to gain access to that data and be able to to use it in their own research, which is to say, what is",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,the name of the system?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"We're calling the bot Cicero, Cicero.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And what's the name like that?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,You're open sourcing?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"What's the name of the repository and, and the like the project?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Is it also just called sister with a big project?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Are you still coming up with a name?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"The data set comes from this website, web diplomacy.net Is the site that's been online for like 20 years now and it's been One of the main sites that people use to play diplomacy on it, we've got like 50,000 games of diplomacy with natural language communication, over 10 million messages.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So it's a pretty massive data set that people can use to.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"We're hoping that the academic community, the research community, is able to use it for all sorts of interesting research questions.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So to you from having studied this game is a sufficiently rich problem space to explore this kind of human AI interaction.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, absolutely.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And I think it's, I think it's maybe the best data set that I can think of out there to to investigate these kinds of questions of negotiation, trust, persuasion, I wouldn't say it's the best data set in the world for human AI interaction.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,That's a very broad field.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But I think that it's definitely up there as like, you know, if you're really interested in language models interacting with humans in, you know, a setting where their incentives are not fully aligned.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,This seems like an ideal data set for investigating that.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"you have you have a paper with some impressive results, and just an impressive paper that taking this problem on what's the most exciting thing to you in terms of the results from the paper?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Well, I think there's ideas or results.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, I think there's a few aspects of the results, and that I think, are really exciting.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So first of all, the fact that we were able to achieve such strong performance, I was surprised by and pleasantly surprised by.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So we played 40 games of diplomacy with real humans, and the bot placed second, out of all players that have played five or more games.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So it's about 80 players total 19, of whom played five or more games, and the bot was ranked second out of those players.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And the bot was was really good in two dimensions, one, being able to establish strong connections with the other players on the board, being able to, like, persuade them to work with it, being able to coordinate with them about like, how it's going to work with them.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And then also the raw, tactical and strategic aspects of the game, you know, being able to understand what the other players are likely to do being able to model their behavior and respond appropriately to that.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"The bot also really excelled at,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"what are some interesting things that the bot said, By the way, you're lots of swear in the car, there are rules to what you're allowed to say and not in diplomacy.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"You can say whatever you want, I think the site will get very angry at you if you start like threatening somebody.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And if we act,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"like if you threaten somebody, you're supposed to do it politely, yeah, politely,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"you know, like keep it in character.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"That we actually had a researcher watching the bot 24/7 for a while, whenever we play a game, we had a bot watching it to make sure that it wouldn't go off the rails and start like threatening somebody or something like that.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I would,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"just love it if the bots started like mocking, mocking everybody, like some weird quirky strategies would emerge that have you seen anything interesting that you ha, that's a weird, that's a that's a weed behavior, either the filter or the language model?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,That was weird to you.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"That was yeah, there were definitely like, things that the bot would, would do that were not in line with, like how humans would approach the game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And that in a good way, the humans actually, you know, we've talked to some expert diplomacy players about these results.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And their takeaway is that, well, maybe humans are approaching this the wrong way.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And this is actually like the right way to play the game.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So what's required to win?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Like, what?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,What does it mean to mess up or to exploit the suboptimal behavior of a player?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Like, is there?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Is there optimally rational behavior and irrational behavior the to estimate that kind of stuff?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Lex Fridman,"Is there like, a weakness that you can exploit in the game that everybody's looking for?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Well, I think you're asking kind of two questions there.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So one, like modeling the irrationality and the sub optimality of humans, you can't in diplomacy, you can't treat all the other players like their machines.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And if you do that, you're you're going to end up playing really poorly.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And so we actually ran this experiment.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So we, we trained a bot, in a two player zero sum version of diplomacy, the same way that you might approach a game like chess or poker, and the bot was superhuman, it would crush any competitor.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And then we took that same training approach.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And we trained a bot for the full seven player game version of the game through self play, without any human data.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And we stuck it in a game with six humans, and it got destroyed.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Even in the version of the game where there's no explicit natural language communication.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"It still got destroyed, because it just wouldn't be able to understand how the other players were approaching the game and be able to work with that.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Can you can you just linger on that meaning like there's an individual, there's an individual personality Each player and then you're supposed to remember that, but what do you mean, it's not able to understand the players?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Well, it would, for example, expect the human to support it in a certain way, when the human would simply like, Thank you like, No, I'm not supposed to support you here.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"It's kind of like, you know, if you develop a self driving car, and it's trained completely from scratch with other self driving cars, it might learn to drive on the left side of the road.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And that's a totally reasonable thing to do if you're with these other self driving cars that are also driving on the left side of the road.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But if you put it in an American city, it's going to crash.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"But I guess the intuition I'm trying to build up was, what is it then crush a human player heads up.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"This is multiple,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,this is an aspect of two players Euro song versus games that involve cooperation.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So in a two player zero sum game, you can do self play from scratch, and you will arrive at the Nash equilibrium, where you don't have to worry about the other player playing in a very human suboptimal style, that's just going to be the only way that deviating from a Nash equilibrium would would change things is if it helped you.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So what's the dynamic of cooperation that's effective?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And diplomacy?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Do you always have to have one friend in the game,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,you always want to maximize your friends and minimize your enemies?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Got it, and boy, in the line comes into play there.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So the more friends you have the better?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, I mean, I guess you have to attack somebody else, you're not going to make progress.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Right?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So that's,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,the tension.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,But we have this is too real.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"This is too real, too.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"This is too too close to God, geopolitics of actual military conflict in the world.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Okay.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,That's fast.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And so that cooperation element is what makes the game really, really hard.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Yep.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And to give you an, like, an example of how this sub optimality and irrationality comes into play, there's a really common situation in the game of diplomacy, that where one player starts to win, and they're like, at the point where they're controlling about half the map, yeah, and the remaining players who have all been fighting each other, the whole game, all have to, like work together now to stop this other player from winning, or else everybody's gonna lose.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And it's kind of like, you know, Game of Thrones, like, really seen the show, like, you know, he got the the others coming from the north, and like, all the people have to start work out the differences and stop them from from taking over.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And the bot will do this, the bot will work with the other players to stop the superpower from winning.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But if it doesn't really, if it's trained from scratch, or it doesn't really have a good grounding in how humans approach it, it will also at the same time, attack the other players with its extra units.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So all the units that are not necessary to stop the superpower from winning, it will use those to grab as many centers as possible from the other players.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And in totally rational play, the other players should just live with that, you know, they have to understand like, hey, a score of one is better than a score of zero.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So, so, okay, he's grabbed my centers, but I'll just deal with it.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,But humans don't act that way.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Right?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,The human gets really angry at the bot and ends up throwing the game.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Because, you know, I'm going to screw you over because you did something that's not fair to me.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Got it?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And I suppose the model that is the Boss Boss model, that kind of human frustration?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,exactly.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And so that is something that seems almost impossible to model purely from scratch without any human data.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,It's a very cultural thing.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so you need human data, to be able to understand that, hey, that's how humans behave.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And you have to work around that it might be suboptimal and might be rational.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But, but that's an aspect of humanity that you have to you have to deal with.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So how difficult is it to train on human data given that human data is very limited, versus what the US a purely self play mechanism can generate?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"That's actually one of the major challenges that we faced in the research that we had a good amount of human data, we had about 50,000 games, what we try to do is leverage as much self play as possible, while still leveraging the human data.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So what we do is we do self play, very similar to how it's been done in poker and go, but we try to regularize the self play towards the human data.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Basically, the way to think about it is we penalize the bot for choosing actions that are very unlikely under how under the human data set.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so, you",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"know, is there some kind of function that says, This is human like and not?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, so we we train a bot through supervised learning to model the human play as much as possible.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So we basically like train a neural net on those 50,000 games.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And that gives us an approximate that gives us a policy that resembles to some extent how humans actually play the game.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, this isn't a perfect model of human play.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Because we don't have unlimited data.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"We don't have unlimited neural net that capacity, but it gives us some approximation.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Is there some data on the internet that's useful besides just diplomacy?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So on the language side of things, is there some can you go to like Reddit?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And so sort of background model formulation that that's useful for the game of diplomacy?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, absolutely.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so for the language model, which is kind of like a separate question, you know, we didn't use the language model during self play training.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But we pre trained the language model on, you know, tons of internet data as much as possible.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And then we fine tuned it specifically on to diplomacy games.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So we are able to, like leverage the wider data set in order to fill in some of the gaps and like how communication happens more broadly, besides just like, specifically in these diplomacy games.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Okay, cool.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So what some, what are some interesting things that came to life from this from this work?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"To you like, what, what are some insights about, about games, where natural language is involved in cooperation, deep cooperation is involved?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Well, I think there's a few insights.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So first of all, the fact that you can't rely purely or even largely on soft play that you really have to have an understanding of how humans approach the game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I think that that's one of the major conclusions that I'm drawing from this work.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And that is, I think, applicable more broadly to a lot of different games.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So we've actually already taken the approaches that we've used in diplomacy and try them on a cooperative card game called Hanabi.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And we've had a lot of success in that game as well.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"On the language side, I think the fact that we were able to control the language model, through this intense approach was very effective.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And it allowed us, instead of just imitating how humans would communicate, we're able to go beyond that and able to feed into it superhuman strategies, that it can then, you know, generate messages corresponding to,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,is there something you can say about detecting whether a person or AI is lying or not?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,The bot doesn't explicitly try to calculate whether somebody is lying or not.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But what it will do is try to predict what actions they're going to take, given the communications, given the messages that they've sent to us.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So given our conversation, what do I think you're going to do?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And implicitly, there is a calculation about whether you're lying to me in that, you know, if, if you're based on your messages, if I think you're going to attack me this turn, even though your messages say that you're not, then, you know, essentially, the bot is predicting that you're lying.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,But it doesn't view it as as lying the same way that we would view it as lying.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,But you could probably reformulate with all the same data and make a classifier lying or not.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, I think I think you could do that.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,That was not something that we were focused on.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But I think that it is possible that, you know, if you came up with some measurements of like, what does it mean to tell a lie?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Because there's a spectrum, right?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Like, if you're withholding some information, is that a lie?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"If you mostly telling the truth, but you forgot to mention this, like one action out of like, 10?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Is that a lie?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,It's hard to draw the line.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But you know, if you're willing to do that, and then you could possibly use it to do",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,this feels like an argument inside a relationship.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Now, what constitutes a lie?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Depends what you mean by the definition of the word is, okay.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Still, it's fascinating, because trust and lying is all intermixed into this.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And it's language models that are becoming more and more sophisticated.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,It's just a fascinating space to explore.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,What what do you see as the future of this work?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,That is inspired by the breakthrough performance that you're getting here with diplomacy?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I think there's a few different directions to take this work.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I think really, what it's showing us is the potential that language models have.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I mean, I think a lot of people didn't think that this kind of result was possible even today, despite all the progress that's been made in language models.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And so it shows us how we can leverage the power of things like self play on top of language models to get increasingly better performance.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And the ceiling is really much higher than what we have right now.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Is this transferable somehow to chatbots for the more general task of dialogue, because there is a kind of negotiation here a dance between entities that are trying to cooperate and at the same time, a little bit adversarial, which I think maps somewhat to the general you know, the entire process of Reddit or like internet communication, you you're cooperating, you're adversarial, you have debates you're having camaraderie, all that kind of stuff.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I think one of the things that's really useful about diplomacy is that we have a well defined value function, there is a well defined score that the bot is trying to optimize in.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And in a in a setting like a general Chatbot.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Setting, it needs it would need that kind of objective in order to fully leverage the techniques that we've developed.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"What about like what we talked about earlier with NPCs, inside video games can be used to create for Elder Scrolls six more compelling NPCs that you could talk to, instead of, instead of committing all kinds of violence with a sword, and fighting dragons, just sit in a tavern and drink all day and talk to the Chatbot.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,The way that we've approached it in diplomacy is you condition the language on an intent.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now that intent and diplomacy is an is an action, but it doesn't have to be.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And you can imagine, you know, you could have NPCs, in video games, or the metaverse or whatever, where there's some intent, or there's some objective that they're trying to maximize.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And you can specify what that is.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And, and then the language can corresponds to that intent.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, I'm not saying that this is, you know, happening imminently.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But I'm saying that this is like a future application, potentially, of this direction of research.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So what's the more general formulation of this making self play, be able to skill with self play does and still maintain human like behavior,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"the way that we've approached self play in diplomacy is like, we're trying to come up with good intends to condition the language model on in the space of intense is actions that can be played in the game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now there is like the potential to have a broader set of intense things like, you know, long term cooperation, or long term objectives, or, you know, gossip about what another player was saying.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,These are things that we're currently not conditioning the language model on.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so it's not able to, we're not able to control it to say like, oh, you should be talking about this thing right now.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,But it's quite possible that you could expand the scope of intends to be able to allow it to talk about those things.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, in the process of doing that, the self play would become much more complicated.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And so that is a potential for future work.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Okay, the",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"increase in the number of antennas, I still not quite clear how you keep the self play, integrated into the human world.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, I'm a little bit loose on the, on understanding how you do that.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So we train a neural nets to imitate the human data as closely as possible.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And that's what we call the anchor policy.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And now, when we're doing self play, the problem with the anchor policy is that it's not a perfect approximation of how humans actually play.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Because we don't have infinite data.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Because we don't have unlimited neural network capacity.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,It's actually a relatively suboptimal approximation of how humans actually play.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And we can improve that approximation by adding planning and RL.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so what we do is, we get a better approximation, a better model of human play by during the self play process, we say you can deviate from this human anchor policy, if there is an action that has, you know, particularly high expected value.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,But it would have to be a really high expected value in order to deviate from from this human life policy.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So you basically say try to maximize your expected value, while at the same time stay as close as possible to the Human Policy.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And there is a parameter that controls those, the relative weighting of those competing objectives.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So the question I have is, how sophisticated can the Anker policy get to have a policy that approximates human behavior?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Right?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Yep.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So as you increase the number of intents, as you generalize the space in which this is applicable, and given that the human data is limited, try to anticipate a policy that works for a much larger number of cases.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Like how difficult is the process of forming a damn good anchor policy?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Well, it really comes down to how much human data you have.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So it's all about skin and the human data.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I think the more human data you have, the better.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And I think that that's going to be the major bottleneck in in scaling to, to more complicated domains.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But that said, you know, there might be the potential just like in the language model, where we leveraged, you know, tons of data on the internet and then specialized it for diplomacy.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"There is the future potential that you can leverage huge amounts of data across the board, and then specialize it in the data set that you have for diplomacy and that way, you're essentially augmenting the amount of data that you have.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,To what degree does this apply?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I to the general, the real world diplomacy, the geopolitics, you know, there's a game theory has a history of being applied to understand and to give us hope about nuclear weapons, for example, the mutually assured destruction is a game theoretic concepts that you can formulate.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Some people say it's over simplified, but nevertheless, here we are.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And we somehow haven't blown ourselves up.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Do you see a future where this kind of this kind of system can be used to help us make decisions geopolitical decisions in the world?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Well, like I said, the original motivation for the game of diplomacy was the failures of World War One, the diplomatic failures that led to war.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Noam Brown,There's always a better outcome than more for all the parties involved.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And my hope is that, you know, as AI progresses, then maybe this technology could be used to help people make better decisions across the board.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt

Lex Fridman,"My guess is that if the president United States got together with Volodymyr Zelensky, and Vladimir Putin that there'll be significant benefit to the president, United States not having an ego, of kind of playing down of giving away a lot of chips for the future success of a world.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So giving a lot of power to the two presidents have the competing nations to achieve peace.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,That's my guess.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,But it'd be nice to run a bunch of simulations.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"But then you have to have human data, right?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"You really, because it's like the game of diplomacy is fundamentally different than geopolitics.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"You need data you need like, I guess that's the question I have, like, how transferable is this to?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Like, I don't know, any kind of negotiation, right?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Like to any kind of like some local, I don't know, a bunch of lawyers, like argue, a divorce, like divorce lawyers, like how transferable this all kinds of human negotiation?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Well, I feel",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,like this isn't a question that's unique to diplomacy.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I mean, you think you look at RL breakthroughs, reinforcement learning breakthroughs in previous games, as well, like, you know, AI for StarCraft, AI for Atari, you haven't really seen it deployed in the real world, because you have these problems of, it's really hard to collect a lot of data.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And you don't have, you don't have a well defined action space, you don't have a well defined reward function.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"These are all things that you really need for reinforcement, learning and planning to be really successful today.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, there are some domains where you do have that cogeneration is one example.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,theorem proving mathematics.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"That's another example where you have a well defined action space, you have a well defined reward function.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And those are the kinds of domains where I can see RL in the short term being incredibly powerful.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But yeah, I think that those are the barriers to deploying this at scale in the real world.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But the hope is that in the long run, we'll be able to get there,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"you have a seat diplomacy feels like closer to the real world than does StarCraft, because it's natural language as you're operating in the space of intense and in space of natural language that feels very close to the real world.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And it also feels like you could get data on that, from the internet.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, and that's why I do think that diplomacy is taking a big step closer to the real world than anything that's came before in terms of game AI breakthroughs.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"The fact that, you know, we're, we're communicating in natural language, we've, we're leveraging the fact that we have this like general dataset of dialogue and communication from a breadth of the internet's that is, that is a big step in that direction.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"We're not 100% there, but, but we're getting closer at least.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So we actually return back to Poker and chess, are some of the ideas that you're learning here with diplomacy, because you construct AI systems that play like humans, like make for fun opponent in a game of chess.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, absolutely, we've already started looking into this direction a bit.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So we tried to use the techniques that we've developed for diplomacy to make Chess and Go AIs.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And what we found is that it led to much more human like strong Chess and Go players, the way that AIS like Stockfish.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Today, play is in a very inhuman style, it's very strong, but it's very different from how humans play.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so we can take the techniques that we've developed for diplomacy, we do something similar in, in Chess and Go, and we end up with a bot that's both strong and human like to elaborate on this a bit like one way to approach making a human like AI for chess, is to collect a bunch of human games like a bunch of human Grandmaster games, and just do supervised learning on those games.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But the problem is that if you do that, what you end up with is an AI that's substantially weaker than the human grandmasters that you trained on, because the neural net is not able to approximates the nuance of the strategy.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"If this goes back to the planning thing that that I mentioned, the search thing that I talked about before, that these human grandmasters, when they're playing, they're using search, and they're using planning, and the neural net alone, unless you have a massive neural net, that's like 1000 times bigger than what we have right now, it's not able to approximate those details very effectively.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And on the other hand, you can leverage search and planning very heavily, but then what you end up with is an AI that plays in a very different style from how humans play the game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, if you strike this intermediate balance by setting the regularization parameters correctly, and say you can do planning, but try to keep it close to the Human Policy, then you end up with an AI that plays in both a very human lifestyle, and a very strong style.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And you can actually even tune it to have a certain Ehlo rating.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So you can say playing the style of like a 2800 Ehlo.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Human.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,I wonder if you could do specific type of humans or categories of humans.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So not just skill, but style.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, I think so.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so this is this is where the, the research gets interesting.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Like, you know, one of the things that I was thinking about is, and this is actually already being done at the there's a researcher at the University of Toronto that's working on this is to make an ad of plays in the style of a particular player.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Like Magnus Carlsen, for example, you can make an AI that plays like Magnus Carlsen and that where I think this gets interesting is like, maybe you're up against Magnus Carlsen and the World Championship or something you can play against this Magnus Carlsen bought to prepare against the real Magnus Carlsen and you can try to explore strategies that he might struggle with, and try to figure out like how to beat this player in particular.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"On the other hand, you can also have Magnus Carlsen working with this bot to try to figure out where he's weak, and where he needs to improve his strategy.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so I can envision this future where data on specific Chess and Go players becomes extremely valuable, because you can use that data to create specific models of how these particular players play.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So increasingly human like behavior and bots, however, as you've mentioned, makes cheating.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Cheat detection much harder.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"It does Yeah, the way that cheat detection works.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"In a game like poker and a game like chess and go from what I understand is trying to see like is this person making moves that are very common among chess AIS, or, you know, AIS in general, but very uncommon among top human players.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And if you have the development of these AIs that play in a very strong style, but also very human lifestyle, then that poses serious challenges for cheat detection.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And it makes, you know, ask yourself hard question about what is the role of AI systems as they become more and more integrated in our society.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And this kind of human AI?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Integration has has some deep ethical issues that we should be aware of.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And also, it's a kind of cybersecurity challenge, right?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"For to make, you know, one of the assumptions we have when we play games, is that there's a trust that it's only humans involved.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And they're the better AI systems to create, which makes it super exciting human like AI systems with different styles of humans is really exciting.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,But then we have to have the defense's better and better and better if we're to trust that we can enjoy human versus human game in a deeply fair way.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,It's fascinating.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"It's just, it's humbling.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, I think there's a lot of like negative potential for this kind of technology.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But, you know, at the same time, there's a lot of upside for it as well.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So, you know, for example, right now, it's really hard to learn how to get better in games like chess and poker and go because the way that the AI plays is so foreign and incomprehensible.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But if you have these AIs that are playing, you know, you can say like, oh, I'm at 2000, Ehlo.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Human, how do I get to 2200?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Now you can have an AI that plays in the style of a 2200 Ehlo.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Human, and that will help you get better.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Or, you know, you mentioned this problem of like, how do you know that you're actually playing with humans when you're playing like online and video games?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Well, now we have the potential of populating these, like virtual worlds with agents, like AI agents that are actually fun to play with, and you don't have to always be playing with other humans to, you know, have a fun time.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So, yeah, a lot, a lot of upside potential to and I think, you know, with any sort of tool, there's there's the potential for a lot of greatness and a lot of downsides as well.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So in the paper, they got a chance to look at there's a section on ethical considerations, what's in that section?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,What are some ethical considerations here?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Is it some of the stuff we've already talked about?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"There's some things that we've already talked about, I think, specific to diplomacy.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"You know, there's there's also the, the challenge that the game is, you know, there is a deception aspect of the game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so, you know, how developing language models that are capable of deception is, I think, a dicey issue and something that, you know, makes research on diplomacy particularly challenging.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And, you know, so those kinds of issues of like, should we even be developing ais that are capable of lying to people, that's something that we have to, you know, think carefully about?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So cool.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I mean, that you have to do that kind of stuff in order to figure out where the ethical lines are, but I can see in the future it being illegal to have a consumer product that lies.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Like your personal assistant AI systems not allowed is always have to tell the truth.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"But if I asked him, Do I Do I look, did I get fatter over the past month?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,I sure as hell want that AI system to lie to me.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So there's a trade off between lying and being and being nice.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,We have to somehow find the ethics in that and we're back to discussions inside of relationships.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Anyway, what were you saying?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I was like, yeah, there's Yeah, that's kind of going to the question of like, what is a lot, you know, as a white lie, a bad lie is an ethical lie.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"You know, those kinds of questions.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Boy, we return time and time, again, to deep human questions as we design AI systems.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And that's exactly what they do.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,They put a mirror to humanity.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,To help us understand ourselves.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"There's, there's also the issue of like, you know, in these diplomacy experiments in order to do a fair comparison, you know, what, what we found is that there's an inherent anti AI bias in these kinds of games.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So we actually played a tournaments in a non language version of the game, where, you know, we told the participants like, hey, in every single game, there's going to be an AI.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And what we found is that the humans would spend basically the entire game like trying to figure out who the bot was.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And then as soon as they thought they figured it out, they would all team up and try to kill it.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And, you know, overcoming that inherent anti AI bias is a challenge.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"On the flip side, I think, when robots become the enemy, that's when we get to heal our human divisions, and then we can become one.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,As long as we have one enemy.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"It's that Reagan thing when aliens show up, that's when we will put our side our divisions will become one, one human species,",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"we might have our differences, but we're at least all human.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,At least we all hate,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,the robots.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"No, no, no, I think there will be actually in the future, something like a civil rights movement for robots.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I think that's the fascinating thing about AI systems is they ask, they force us to ask about ethical questions about what is sentience?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,What is?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,How do we feel about systems that are capable of suffering that we're capable of displaying suffering?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And how do we design products that show emotion and not?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,How do we feel about that lying is another topic?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Are we going to allow bots to lie or not?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And where's the balance between being nice and and telling the truth?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I mean, these are all fascinating human questions.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And it's like, so exciting to be in the century, we would create systems that take these philosophical questions that have been asked for centuries, and now can engineer them inside systems, or like, you really have to answer them because you'll have transformational impact on human society, depending on what you design inside those systems.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,That's fascinating.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And like you said, I feel like diplomacy is a step towards the direction of the real world, applying these RL methods towards the real world.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"From from from all the breakthrough performances, and go and chess and Starcraft and Dota This is This feels like the real world.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Especially now my mind's been on war, and military conflict.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,This feels like it can give us some deep insights about human behavior at the large geopolitical scale.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,What do you think?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Is the breakthrough, or the directions of work that will take us towards solving intelligence towards creating AGI systems.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"You've been a part of creating, by the way, we should say part of great teams that do this, of creating systems that achieve breakthrough performances and before thought, unsolvable problems like poker, multiplayer poker diplomacy, we're taking steps towards that direction, what do you think it takes to go all the way to create superhuman level intelligence?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"You know, there's a lot of people trying to figure that out right now.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And, you know, I should say, like, the amount of progress that's been made, especially in the past few years, is truly phenomenal.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I mean, you look at where AI was 10 years ago, and the idea that you can have AI is that can generate language and generate images, the way they're doing today, and able to play a game like diplomacy was just like unthinkable even even five years ago, let alone 10 years ago.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, there are aspects of AI that I think are still lacking.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I think there's general agreements, that one of the major issues with AI today is that it's very data inefficient, it's very, it requires a huge number of samples of training examples, to be able to train, you know, you look at an AI that plays go, and it needs millions of games of go to, to learn how to play the game.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Well, whereas a human can pick it up.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And like, you know, I don't know, how many games is a human Go player, go go Grandmaster play in their lifetime, probably, you know, in the 1000s, or 10s, of 1000s, I guess.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So that's, that's one issue over here, efficiency, overcoming this challenge of data efficiency.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And this is particularly important if we want to deploy AI systems in real world settings, where they're interacting with humans, because you know, for example, with robotics, it's really hard to generate a huge number of samples.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"It's a different story, when you're working in these, you know, totally virtual games where you can play a million games, and it's no big deal.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,I,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"was planning on just launching, like, 1000 of these robots and Austin, I don't think it's illegal for legged robots to roam the streets and just collect data.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,That's not the worst that could happen.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I kind of mean, that's one way to overcome the data efficiency problem.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So like, scale it Yeah.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"I actually tried to see if there's a law against robots, like legged robots just operating in the, in the streets of a major city.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And there isn't, I couldn't find any.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So I'll take it all the way to the Supreme Court.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Robot rights.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Okay.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Anyway, sorry, you were saying?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,So what what are the ideas are getting becoming more data efficient?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I mean, that's, that's the trillion dollar question.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And AI today, I mean, if you can figure out how to make AI systems more more data efficient, then that's a huge breakthrough.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So nobody really knows right?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Now, it could",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,be just a gigantic background model language model.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And then you do, the training becomes like prompting that model to, to essentially do a kind of coring a search into the space of the things it's learned to customize that to whatever problem you're trying to solve.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So maybe if you form a large enough language model, you can go quite quite a long way.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"That, you know, I think there's some truth to that.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I mean, if you look at the way humans approach, a game like poker, they're not coming at it from scratch, they're coming at it with a huge amount of background knowledge about, you know, how humans work how the world works, the idea of money.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So if they're able to leverage that kind of information to, to pick up the game faster.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So it's not really a fair comparison to then compare it to an AI that's like learning from scratch.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And maybe one of the ways that we address this sample complexity problem is by allowing AIS to leverage that general knowledge across a ton of different domains.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So like I said, you did a lot of incredible work in a space of research, and actually building systems, what advice would you give to?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Let's start with beginners?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,What advice would you give to beginners interested in machine learning?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Just there at the very start of their journey, they're in high school and college, thinking like, this seems like a fascinating world.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,What advice would you give them?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Um, I would say that there are a lot of people working on similar aspects of machine learning and to not be afraid to try something a bit difference in my own path in AI, is pretty atypical for machine learning researcher today.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I mean, I started out working on game theory and and then shifting more towards reinforcement learning as time went on.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And that actually had a lot of benefits, I think, because it allowed me to look at these problems in a very different way from the way a lot of machine learning researchers view it.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And that comes with drawbacks in some respects.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Like I think there's definitely aspects of machine learning thing where, you know, I'm weaker than most of the researchers out there.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But I think that diversity of perspective, you know, when I'm working with my teammates, there's something that I'm bringing to the table and something that they're bringing to the table.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And that kind of collaboration becomes very fruitful for that reason.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So that could be problems like, like poker, like you've chosen diplomacy, that can be problems like that still out there that you could just tackle, even if it seems extremely difficult.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I think that there's a lot of challenges, challenges left, and I think having a diversity of viewpoints and backgrounds is really helpful for working together to figure out how to tackle those kinds of challenges",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"as a beginner so that I would say that's, that's more for like a grad student, where they already built up a base like a complete beginner, what's a good journey?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So for you that was doing some more on the math side of things do game theory, or like so it's basically build up a foundation in something so programming mathematics, given the physics, but Bill, build that foundation?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, I would say build a strong foundation in math and computer science and statistics and these kinds of areas, but but don't be afraid to try something that's different and learn something that's different from you know, the, the thing that everybody else is doing to get into machine learning.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"You know, there's there's value in having a different background than everybody else.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Yeah, so.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"But certainly having a strong math background, especially in things like linear algebra, and statistics and probability, are incredibly helpful today for for learning about and understanding machine learning.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Do you think one day we'll be able to since you've taken steps from poker to diplomacy?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"One day, we'll be able to figure out how to live life optimally?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"Well, what is it like in poker and diplomacy, you need a value function, you need to have a reward system.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,And so what does it mean to live a life that's optimal?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"So okay, so then you can exactly like, lay down a reward function being like, I want to be rich, or I want to be I want to be in a happy relationship.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And then you'll say, Well, do X.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"You know, there's, there's a lot of talk today about in AI safety circles about like, Miss specification of, you know, reward function.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"So you, you say like, okay, my objective is to be rich, and maybe the AI tells you like, Okay, well, if you want to maximize the probability that you're rich, go rob a bank.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Sure.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"And so you want to, is that?",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Is that really what you want?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Is your objective really to be rich at all costs?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,Or is it more nuanced than that?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,So,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,the unintended consequences?,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Yeah.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Yeah, so maybe, that's, maybe life is more about defining the reward function that minimizes the unintended consequences, then it is about the actual policy that gets you to the reward function.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Maybe life is just about constantly updating the reward function.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,"I think one of the challenges in life is figuring out exactly what that reward function is, sometimes, it's pretty hard to specify the same way that you know, trying to handcraft the optimal policy in a game like chess is really difficult.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Noam Brown,It's not so clear cut what the reward function is for for life.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,I think one day AI will figure it out.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,And I wonder what that would be.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,Until then.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,I just really appreciate the kind of work you're doing.,Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"And it's really fascinating taking the leap into a more a more real world like problem space, and just achieving incredible results by applying reinforcement learning.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
Lex Fridman,"Now, since I saw your work on poker, you've been in constant inspiration.",Noam Brown - AI vs Humans in Poker and Games of Strategic Negotiation.txt
